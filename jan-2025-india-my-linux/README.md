## My domains:
- statsforstartups.com: the website of kpis 
- mecattaf.dev: personal website which also serves as a directory of all my websites
- leger.run: experiment for ai SaaS, show investors, push Intel local, whjere we log "future is small models" and speak about quantization and hardware optimization for local LLMs for certain devices through our support of ramalama
- agency.agency: open source tool for building stateful agents

# mecattaf.dev contents sitemap 

This is my main personal website, which was already purchased and made available on my personal cloudflare.
I transition my email to thomas@mecattaf.dev and redirect all accounts to it. Personal calendar is also centralized there.

List of topics to showcase:
- Tech stack ie. "how i run my tech" + rename my COPR to Enoki

### 1) "Zen" to Enoki OS: Bluebuild based system (and show lineage)
- Used Kali linux on the nokia n900 for doing penetration testing on wifi networks
- Would root my android devices with custom ROMs (and list the phone lineage)
- Rediscovered coding with Data Science at Columbia (hardeep johar and daniel guetta's intro to python for data science classes); dual booted ubuntu or used it on virtual machine
- stuck with windows because it has rekordbox but eventually stopped because it killed my dell xps 13 2-in-1
- at my first job, i was given a CentOS server on a digitalocean droplet and we had automated weekly scripts in bash + cronjob which pulled the entire crunchbase dataset and do some data cleaning with python and postgres (one-man ETL setup)
- on this cheap cloud computer we also hosted the first statsforstartups webserver which held for over 5 years
- although on paper my first job as a venture analyst at charge ventures (2019-2021) i got to flex my coding skills by using a lot of ds/ml and ai tooling that were still in early days. this included interacting with an early GPT 2 model via private beta in 2019 and i remember feeling underwhelmed by it. this also includes early interaction with clay and baseten's product where the available models were tools like image styletransfer and BERT-based transformer text summarization
- since windows killed my devices i vowed to transition to linux fully. as a covid passion project, i entered the tiling window manager rabbit hole starting with i3 on regolith linux: https://regolith-linux.org/ which is now past version 3: https://regolith-desktop.com/ 
- i rediscovered vim and learned REAL git and generally reading the fucking manual (rtfm) (felt like building legos). at this point i learned enough about linux to be a senior devops engineer level sysadmin.

### 2) "dots-zen" to Dotfiles
Dotfiles are meant to be hidden in the OS. this has changed a lot for me in the past few years. 
this is where i show off my TEX keyboards
- few words on typing versus mouse+keyboard combo and explan how it can be done with touch. show studies of how long we spend going back and forth between the mouse and the keyboard. split keyboards and dvorak are not on the table, this is as far as I go (i m not that crazy).
- mneumonics and shortcuts while remaining minimal in my setup, including my shortcut sheets:
    - swayfx: blur and rounded borders + kanshi
    - fabric as unified widget system, migrating from waybar rofi mako wlogout and a lot of custom scripts at the time
    - fish, starship, and other rust utils for embelished cli experience
    - kitty + terminal shortcuts: specifically for images, and using ctrl shift H to view and select text
    - nvim + fzf as a superpower with an explanation of the available tools
    - aider for local LLM operations

### 3) writings for the statsforstartups project:
- how it kickstarted my career + show metrics for engagement
- migration to v2 and ai content blog post
- thoughts on data-driven entrepreneurship to be compiled from my notion notes
- platform now has more informatin for contributors (becomes a wiki announcement)

My bio: 
- podcast appearances
- the s4s presentations over time
- my notes on entrepeneurship (eventually): my startup playbooks and accelerators resource bank (with all the authors i read)
- some talks given at stanford, hbs, boston university, and nyu

### 4) Books
I am often asked about recommendations, so fortunately for you i have digitized my entire library. 
Section called "Bonus": Displays Cooking recipes and Favorite spots in the city. "if you stumbled here by accident you really have way too much free time on your hands!"

### 5) Academic material:
- Like the "masters" book by daft punk. This is where i go through my project of listing 52 influencial books or esays from academia that have influenced me. There is a separate set of chats with LLMs about this. Alan kay mentions how creativity happens on the pink plane vs the bvlue plane. Bret victor has lots of great thoughts that can inspire me there, based on his personal website https://worrydream.com/ and https://dynamicland.org/2024/FAQ/#What_is_Realtalks_relationship_to_AI

- Blog posts are collected here. At some point may include some musings on:
    - Get a coach - as dr Karen explains there the nuance: mentor uses knowledge to inspire, coach is goal oriented and consellor is problem oriented
    - Thoughts on working in public, linked to mario gabriele 
    - Your network is your net worth

## Previous notes on the topic:
 am a startup founder, open source software enthusiast (specifically when it comes to Linux and local ai). i also enjoy sharing some of my adventurous tools that I use as part of my tech stack. i will be doing a lot more of that in the near future as well. 

i would like to also power a personal page where i blog about most things that come to mind. this is musings on entrepreneurship, or generally on company-building. there is a sense of building some things in public - and making sure that projects i sponsor get maximum visibility.
