Hi! This month I've continued working on [Goguma], my IRC client for Android.
I've released version 0.2.0 earlier today. Tons of new features and bug fixes
have been shipped! delthas has added a new old-school compact mode for the
message list, has implemented pinned and muted conversations, and has added a
new UI to manage IRC networks configured on the bouncer. Noah Loomans has
come up with a cool new look for `/me` messages. I've redesigned the UI to
create a new conversation, and added knobs to edit the user profile and channel
topics.

We now have [our own F-Droid repository] with nightly builds, so trying out
Goguma should be easier than manually grabbing APK files. Goguma is also
available on the [official F-Droid repository], although the version published
there lags behind.

On the [soju] bouncer side, delthas has implemented a new [soju.im/search]
extension. This allows clients to search the server-side message history
without having to download the full logs. I've added a tiny
[soju.im/no-implicit-names] extension which allows clients to opt-out of some
chatter sent when connecting. This is useful for mobile devices where
re-connections are frequent, data plans are limited and latency is high. Last,
delthas has added support for the [echo-message] extension for upstream
servers in order to properly display messages mutated by the server (e.g. to
strip formatting).

In SourceHut news, the initial release of [hut] has been published! Some
distributions have already started shipping it in their official repositories.
hut is now integrated in builds.sr.ht itself: hut will automatically pick up
the OAuth 2.0 token generated by the `oauth` directive. For example:

```yaml
image: alpine/edge
packages:
- hut
oauth: meta.sr.ht/PROFILE:RO
tasks:
- hi: |
    hut meta show
```

I've also resumed work on [go-emailthreads] again. It's the successor to
[python-emailthreads] which currently powers lists.sr.ht's patch review UI.
I've finished up the basics and integrated it into lists.sr.ht's GraphQL API.
The next step is to update the Python frontend to use data from the GraphQL API
instead of using python-emailthreads.

The <abbr title="New Project of the Month">NPotM</abbr> is [libdisplay-info].
This is a shared project with other Wayland developers (Pekka Paalanen,
Sebastian Wick) and driver developers (AMD, Intel). The goal is to build a
small library for [EDID] and [DisplayID], two standards for display device
metadata. Right now compositors don't need to parse a lot of the EDID, but
that's going to change with upcoming color management support. Some interesting
discussions have sparkled, but progress is slow. I guess that's expected when
collaboratively building a new library from scratch: it takes time to make
everybody agree.

That's all for now! See you next month.
