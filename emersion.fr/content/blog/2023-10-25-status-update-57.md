Hi all, long time no see! It's been more than two months since the last status
update. My excuse for this silence is two-fold: I was on leave for 5 weeks,
and then [X.Org Developer's Conference][XDC] happened. During my time off,
I've traveled in Korea and Japan. I will be blunt: these last two months have
been fantastic! And to be honest, that's a huge understatement.

After my trip in Asia, I went to a 2-day Valve hackfest in Igalia's
headquarters. I met other Valve contractors there, we discussed about various
topics such as color management, variable refresh rate, flicker-free startup,
and more.

At XDC, there were lots of interesting talks and workshops: HDR by Joshua and
Melissa, NVK by Faith, Asahi by Alyssa et al, wlroots frame scheduling by Rose
(my GSoC student), CI by Martin, VKMS by Ma√≠ra, Wine Wayland by Alexandros,
Wine X11 by Arek, and many more! Everything should be available online if you
haven't watched live. That said, as usual, the part I enjoyed the most is the
so-called hallway track. It's great to have free-form discussions with fellow
graphics developers, it results in a pretty different train of thought than the
usual focused discussions we have online.

Apart from these events, I've found some time to do a bit of actual work, too.
I've re-spinned an old patch I wrote to introduce a new [CLOSEFB] IOCTL, to
allow a DRM master to leave a framebuffer on-screen when quitting so that the
next DRM master can take over without a black screen in-between. This time I
also included a user-space patch and an IGT test (both requirements for new
kernel uAPI). I sent (and merged) [another kernel patch][relax registered check]
to fix black screens in some situations when unplugging USB-C docks.

On the Wayland side, I continued working on explicit synchronization, updating
the protocol and submitting a [gamescope patch]. Joshua has been working on a
[Mesa patch], so all of the pieces are coming together now. On the SourceHut
side, I've sent a patch to add HTTP/2 support to [pages.sr.ht]. It's been
merged and deployed, enjoy! The
<abbr title="New Project of the Two Months">NPotTM</abbr> is [libicc], a small
library to parse ICC profile files. Unlike LittleCMS, it provides lower-level
access to the ICC structure and the exact color transformation operations.

That's all for now, see you next month!
