I am officially a failed founder. üè∑Ô∏è
The two products I built in the past 8 months since leaving my job went nowhere. I think I now know why and what I would do differently.

When I started my career in Software Engineering, I used to think that building technology was the most important activity of them all.
No technology, nothing else matters ‚Ñ¢
Dumb mindset...

I then learned that Sales is also a kind of science, not just taking clients out to dinner. This started a shift in my perception, but it was still early and not enough.

Then, I moved countries and in time I had the terrific luck to work with top class Product Managers in successful companies, from scale-ups to publicly traded companies.

Things started to click. I started to understand other functions better (customer success, sales, marketing, operations) but I deliberately started to learn about Product more than any other as I felt that's where things really start from.

As an Engineering Manager, I shifted from arguing for 20% technical debt in each sprint to putting a customer value on each task. Sometimes paying the tech debt had the greatest value, sometimes it didn't.

I even had a couple of stints where I held both PM and EM role and I loved it.

I thought this is it! I now know it all.
I won't start with a technology like I would have 10 years ago, but I will start with a problem, an experience, and work my way back to the technology like a Product person would do. I am ready to become an entrepreneur.
Dumb mindset (II)...

8 months and a lot of savings spent later, I realise that things actually start with go to market (GTM). Even if Product eventually ends up tying everything together, that's not where a business starts from.

Here's how I would (re)start today:

Ideal customer profile
‚Ü≥who needs this?
‚Ü≥who makes the buying decision?
‚Ü≥what pain points am I solving?

Unique value proposition
‚Ü≥what is my core message?
‚Ü≥what makes my solution different?
‚Ü≥what quantifiable benefits can I prove?

Packaging
‚Ü≥what is the core offering?
‚Ü≥what is the pricing? Is it based on feature tiers, usage tiers, etc?
‚Ü≥how much can I actually charge?

Distribution
‚Ü≥how am I actually going to sell this?
‚Ü≥who are the incumbents?
‚Ü≥how big is the market? is it a new or mature market?

Metrics
‚Ü≥lead gen rate, CAC, sales cycle length, LTV, AOV (ü§Ø please stop...)
‚Ü≥what are the signals I need to keep track of?

If all the above checks out, and I can prove the demand exists, it is then and only then that I should go and sketch out 1-2 features and a flaky prototype.
Absolutely nothing gets built otherwise.

Tuition fee paid, lesson learned. But I still have a problem: I am a builder and for me all the above is "boring work". But I also know I can't get away without doing it.

Time to regroup and take another shot, but this time starting with GTM and using automations to keep some sanity (üëá)

Dumb mindset (III) in progress?
Time will tell.
