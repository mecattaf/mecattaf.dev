Rohan  
Didn t ielterate fast enough. Feed ack loops not fast enough  
Too stuck into weeds of let s build this ignore signals. Replit pushing features.  
Founder mkit fit we were not the right ppl. Not dev centric  
Level of urgency cf and burn. Think it was going fine. Each month is extra burn.  
Better assessment of skills needed on team. We needed a figma beast. Needed sales exp, 0 to 1 salesman. Or somebody with willingne  ss to do it.  
Could have been more resourc eful. Paid contractors decent amount, should have thought of better way to get high output w min financial input. More investigation on free resources.  
Too explocit in terms of delegation: rigidity in roles put people in silo.  
Better at roadmapping: where we wanted to end up. Clearer timelines clearly  defined. More intentional about deadlines.  
Knowing if you re b2b or b2c. We though b2d2b was the way.

Making the business a well oiled machine is primordial. SOP l, every month flthird friday of the month get notes to investors   
Every monday put down priority and collectively priortiize. Honest conv about burn rate, perso conv. How the hell do u focus on work if no cash coming in   
Being quick to kill a product or feature or a priority. Done analyais on feedback and relaoze it s not high priority feature. Every day wasted is a day you dnt get bakc to move the needle. 

Work like lion  
Feel like i was running. Ceo dilemma: being a visionary while  balancing execution of that (understanding operator role). They need to be grounded in the team s execution of that vision and how long that s gonna take. "Ceo wants it done yesterday." How do u balance that division with execution time   
Diallo was like thomas keeps printing ideas. In hindsight it was what i should have been doing but should have been grounded in reality of current state of product amd what it would truly be. When u have limited eng repsurces amd hands, how do u execute. Priorities gotta align priperly then waste time on non hogh priority thing.   
Reactivity: new info coming in. Reframe. Out of your 50 ideas What are the next 10 that people will pay for. Deep customer centric approach. Roadmap revolves around that.

Thinking what s best for your business vs what s best for investor. Was thinking theough lens of nicest narrative, how to mtiigate tech moat. Teuth of matter none of those come up w those. Nobody s gonna argue with million arr. Moat defensivility roadmap but live in moment: revenues are coming in. Balancing expectation of investor va of the business

Tom:

\- sequencing issue: pretty things, growthrocks. External devs.  
\- trello board graveyard for good ideas.   
\- eng era bygone, but slow. Bad at scoping or overambitious  
\- shitty product. Not coherent. Stiching shit together.  
\- listened to the commentators  
\- how can we make sure there always more money in the bank. Assume you won t ever raisen. Worked based on assumption that we ll raise millions in funding in next few months  
\- should have anchored salaries on carta data.  
\- only so much you can do to dress up the pig like a pig with lipstick. Knew that deep down. But i spent on fundraising  
\- but culpability we all share on product perspective. So it s a sequencing problem. It s all about the roadmapm  
\- parallelization of tasks: fundraising little bit today, little bit tomorrow. Even if just scratching surface on each. Good for routine building. Setup crm, pull   
\- guilt and shame was unwarranted. Drop off from monthly update. How do you make sure what ur saying this month is not happening. What do you with that? Then there s no urgency to step up and make sure that those updates are not concrete. Even if pretna is nice, internally we should have said No this is not on track  
\- asks: should have an email that this is what we want from you. Part of monthly update. Intros to top devs from startups, companies that could be a good fit. Or we can leverage to improve customer discovery  
Sergio:  
\- cheap tests vs expensive "big bets"

Evolution path  
Sales? Try sales fundraising hiring  
Eng? You re ML. Now on your way to product, brand, design. 

Re hiring: fashinable these days to "only hire previous founders". I agree w that

Generational product: "the linear" of meetings. Not easy. 

Get to the well oiled machine fast.  
L ;  
Couple therapy. Values doc. Keep it going. Weekly vibe check. Hard with M/F dynamic.   
chila men rasak. 

Evaluate your flaws to the max. This is the true hiring pipeline.   
Rene likes psychology so he is predisposed to smth called hyperintellectualization. This is protecting your emotional part.

Habillage: manifesto, vision  
Fanbase 

Amount of fund raised is a dick measuring contest. Truly. You re working as if this is the last amt you ll ever raise

Current obj is This section: customer love from twitter and fancy sexy cos. YC is amazing for this but true arr growth comes from capturing the long tail.   
Linkedin is the way to go. 

I need to reframe a perception. You didn t "skip" the corporate job (your investors are your boss now). You just started the game on Hard difficulty and without spending 2 yrs working "for a great boss". Or having easy, measurable wins. You re in for a series of reality checks, hearbreaks (giving it your all doesn t always work, inputs \!= Outputs). Embrace the nonlinearity of it all.   
But there are proxies to that: coaches.  
It s not uni. You are no longer graded.   
I got all this advice and still failed my first company. Being analytical as we are is a short term handicap but a long trrm superpower. You will be less of a pure doer. And that s fine.
