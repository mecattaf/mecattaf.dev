we could mention as closing thoughts that our hunch of changing the ide space was not wrong. there was potential to change how devs work. they were not "attched to vscode forever"
it was not the idea that was flawed. it was the execution

just take a look at cursor ai or winsurf etc.
we candidly did not build the right team, with the "right dna", to be the ones to solve this problem. this doesn't mean we could never do it. but we did not have enough iterations on product and speaking with customers to get there.
