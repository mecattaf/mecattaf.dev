## Introduction

If you don’t have a clear and simple strategic plan you’re either relying on guesswork or using whichever tactics drive the most engagement.

Doing this work at the professional level is all about executing a strategic plan. It’s where you know your goals, you know your objectives, you know your strategy, and then you execute the tactics best designed to achieve that strategy.

In this post, I want to outline six broad strategic plans which have been successful for clients we’ve worked with in the past (or, in one case, a course student). Consider these ‘off the shelf’ strategies you can use for your community work.

Don’t use them wholesale, but adapt them to suit your needs.

 

### Template 1: Advocacy Communities

Advocacy communities are designed to get customers to plead the case of the brand to non-customers.

Picture these efforts on a continuum. At one extreme you have cult fans who support you because they love you. Supreme and HarleyDavidson probably fall into this group. At the other extreme, you have reward/incentive-driven communities. Most of Influitive’s clients fall into this group.

Between the two, you have word-of-mouth marketing efforts. This is when when people who know you/like you share something you’ve created because it’s remarkable, involves them, or helps the audience look good.

Key Behaviors

The most common behaviors here, in order of value, are typically:

Direct selling/referrals to others. If a customer personally invites someone else to become a customer for the brand or make referrals to a sales team to someone who would be a good fit for the product, that’s a big win.
Writing customer reviews. This includes writing positive reviews on sites like Amazon, Goodreads, TrustRadius, and any other comparison site.
Creating brand-related content. This is when a customer creates positive articles, videos, or podcasts about the product. Gamers do this on Twitch and YouTube all the time.
Sharing content on news/content on social. This is where members share discounts, announcements of new releases, or any other brand-content to others.
 

Strategic Plan Template – Video Game Advocacy

The challenge here is to design community objectives (member behaviors) which achieve two goals. First, they must directly help the community achieve its goal and second, they must match what different member segments are likely to do.

Our strategic plan may look like the below:


## STEP | DESCRIPTION

### GOAL
Create huge awareness during the launch of new games in the series to directly drive sales from new customers.

### OBJECTIVES (member behavior)
1. Get top contributors (30+ contributions avg. per month) to create video clips of themselves and top players / key moments from the game to share on YouTube, Twitch, and other popular channels.
2. Get our regular and irregular members (1 to 29 contributions per month) to share news and discounts.
3. Get lurkers and visitors to watch, share, and rate the videos created by top players to ensure they rank highly.

### STRATEGIES (emotion)
1. Amplify the sense of superiority and exclusiveness at being part of a group of top members with access to special privileges.
2. Surprise regular/irregular members with powerful rewards for sharing our content on an irregular basis.
3. Amplify the sense of awe at reading the very best tips from the top experts in the field.

### TACTICS (your actions)
- **Strategy 1**: Pay for top contributors to access special training to create world-class videos and early access to play the game.
- **Strategy 1**: Create a separate room/channel for experts to support each other's videos.
- **Strategy 1**: Create a hall-of-fame list for the best and most popular videos shared within the community.
- **Strategy 2**: Send free in-game rewards with increasing regularity for members who attract the most newcomers.
- **Strategy 3**: Create previews and announcements of upcoming videos from top members - ask for help in selecting the best for the hall of fame.


All of this should be based upon research. By the end you should have a small list of 5 to 7 tactics which you will commit significant resources to executing. If you get this right, each member segment will be making their best possible contributions to the community.

 

Template 2: Engagement-Driven, Advertising-Supported, Communities

There is only one kind of community where maximizing engagement is a reasonable target and these are communities driven by advertising.

Most of the big social networks (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Pinterest) fall into this category. As do sites like Reddit, StackOverflow, and Nextdoor (plenty of smaller, hobbyist, sites fall into this category too).

Key Behaviors

The key things you need members to do here typically include:

Getting members to organize members in their own groups. A key principle of exponential engagement growth is fostering sub-groups to increase advertising inventory and member time on platform. This means identifying and nurturing people to run parts of the community.
Ensuring members join and participate in these groups. You can’t have successful groups unless you can get members to join and participate in these groups.
Keep members actively engaged. You need to persuade people to visit and participate frequently to keep the community going.
 

Strategic Plan Template – An Engagement Platform

The challenge for an engagement-driven community is growing at high-speed. This example included the following:


## STEP | DESCRIPTION

### GOAL
Increase available advertising inventory and drive greater advertising revenue.

### OBJECTIVES (member behavior)
1. Get top contributors to create their own groups on topics they are passionate about.
2. Get regulars to create discussions within these groups.
3. Get newcomers to join groups created by top members.
4. Get lurkers/visitors to follow the top leaders within the community for unique insights.

### STRATEGIES (emotion)
1. Amplify the feeling of making a unique impact among the members and contribution to the field.
2. Amplify the feeling of curiosity that there might be ways to improve what you're doing.
3. Amplify the need among newcomers to belong to a group of people most like themselves.
4. Amplify the feeling of exclusiveness and superiority at getting great insights from real experts in the field.

### TACTICS (your actions)
- **Objective 1**: Give members with 1+ year of active contributions the ability to create their own groups in a niche area.
- **Objective 1**: Make creating a top group something that is difficult and members have to maintain a high standard.
- **Objective 2**: Highlight a list of topics for regulars to ask questions about and update these regularly.
- **Objective 3**: Create an onboarding journey with use-cases and emphasis upon the need to belong to your tribe.
- **Objective 4**: Call ‘follow members’ the ‘inside track’ to the best and latest advice on the sector.

For each group you want to amplify a unique motivation. This motivation will be very different for top contributors compared with, say, newcomers or lurkers/visitors. As the platform grows larger, you will need far more specific segmentation of the audience.
 

Template 3: Lead Identification/Generation Communities

Lead generation (and identification) is one of the most underutilized uses for a community. Members provides useful information which could identify them as potential leads for the sales team.

Bringing a list of 50+ leads to your next meeting is a good way to build internal support. However, be careful not to invade the privacy of your members or spam them with unwanted offers. Any outreach from a brand representative needs to be done with careful consideration towards the mindset of the member.

Key Behaviors

Members can identify themselves as leads in multiple ways. These usually include:

Downloading content/attending webinars. Members who submit their details to download product/service related content/attend webinars can be considered as strong community leads.
Sharing problems the product can solve. If members share a problem which the company can solve, someone can reach out to them and ask if they would like help.
Creating content which attracts more search traffic. If members create content which attracts high search traffic, this could generate leads through natural awareness.
Pre-purchase behaviors. Using a lead-scoring system, you might identify potential leads through the discussions and posts members click on.
Completing surveys. Occasionally, members might reveal themselves as fitting a lead profile through completion of a survey.
 

Strategic Plan Template – A Large Consultancy Company

Developing a strategic plan for a consultancy company tends to be easier than any other goals. Note, below, the type of platform you use to build this kind of community might be different from a support or advocacy community. Sometimes, you might not need much member to member engagement at all.


## STEP | DESCRIPTION

### GOAL
Generate high-quality leads for the sales team.

### OBJECTIVES (member behavior)
1. Get our top 20 experts (identified manually by the CMGR) to write expert-advice articles.
2. Get our regular, active members (3 to 10 contributions per month) to share their challenges and the kind of advice they need.
3. Get lurkers to sign up to attend webinars and submit details to download resources created by the community.

### STRATEGIES (emotion)
1. Amplify the sense of superiority and exclusiveness at being part of a group of top people working within the field.
2. Amplify the sense of frustration and the relief among regular, active members at being able to finally solve it.
3. Amplify the sense of awe at reading the very best tips from the top experts in the field.

### TACTICS (your actions)
- **Objective 1**: Give top members the unique ability to create content and moderate/manage areas of the community.
- **Objective 1**: Create a separate room/channel for experts to interact with each other.
- **Objective 1**: Ask top members for personal advice and expertise in the running of the community.
- **Objective 2**: Create a ‘frustration zone’ for members to share their biggest frustrations other than solve.
- **Objective 3**: Create previews and announcements prior to the release of the new top tips.


Each of the objectives above should help drive increased search traffic and identify leads within the community.

 

Template 4: Innovation and Insights Communities

We’ve covered this recently. There are plenty of ways members can help drive new insights and innovation. These typically come in the forms of:

Key Behaviors

Generating product ideas. This covers all solicited ideas in ideation-driven platforms.
Voting on product ideas. This is self-explanatory, members vote on the ideas they like best.
Providing feedback on the product/service. This includes every complaint, bug, or frustration members express which can be useful feedback.
Participating in surveys/interviews. This is useful solicited qualitative and quantitative feedback.
Expressing sentiment. If you track what members say they like or dislike you can gather a lot of useful insights.
Engaging in trackable behavior. This includes tracking specific behavior and outcomes e.g. what content or discussions people like best.
Ideation/soliciting ideas tends to gain the more attention but is also the least successful. Better feedback usually comes in response to things members can see, touch, and do.

 

Strategic Plan Template – SaaS company

Many SaaS companies are gradually shifting their community from customer support to insights and innovation. This means rethinking what members are going to do within the community. A recent strategic template included:


## STEP | DESCRIPTION

### GOAL
Generate useful insights which are implemented by the product team.

### OBJECTIVES (member behavior)
1. Get top contributors (avg. 10+ contributions per month) to give rapid feedback solicited by the engineering team.
2. Get irregular members (1 to 5 contributions per month) to highlight and rank their biggest frustrations about the product.
3. Get lurkers/visitors to browse articles/topics they find most interesting.

### STRATEGIES (emotion)
1. Amplify the sense of unique usefulness top contributors feel to shape the future of the product.
2. Amplify the sense of frustrations and possible relief irregulars might feel in having their top problems solved.
3. Increase the sense of curiosity among lurkers/visitors to learn more about the topic and the products’ features.

### TACTICS (your actions)
- **Objective 1**: Give top members insider access to the future product roadmap and advance notice of news.
- **Objective 1**: Build close relationships between the engineering team and top members. Let engineers take problems or solicit feedback directly from a group of top members they know well.
- **Objective 2**: Create a growing list of frustrations which have been resolved by the community efforts.
- **Objective 2**: Create a ‘frustration zone’ for regulars/irregulars to share and highlight their biggest frustrations.
- **Objective 3**: Build a ‘top tips/exploration’ area of the community for visitors/lurkers to browse.


This approach aims to maximize the number of valuable insights generated by the community. We could equally add surveys/interviews at convenient times as an additional objective here.

From this, you should be able to use our insights report template and capture the main insights for the engineering team.

 

Template 5: Support Objectives

Support communities are the easiest type of community to create.

You launch a platform for people with a lot of questions and divert traffic from your website to this platform. It’s also the easiest community type to connect to direct cost savings. Most organizations with 100k+ customers should consider building a support community.

Key Behaviors

Asking questions in the community (instead of support channels). This is obviously a critical behavior for a support community to succeed.
Answering questions in the community (with empathy!). This is equally as important. Questions without solutions are worse than no questions at all.
Searching for an answer in the community. The majority of members should be able to find the answer without asking a question.
Voting and rating answers in the community. You need help from members to vote and rate answers within the community. This helps the best solutions rise to the top.
 

Strategic Plan Template – A Large Consultancy Company

Strategic plans for support communities are usually fairly transferable from one type of community to the next. The key difference is you usually don’t have regulars. You usually have top contributors, a small group of irregulars, then a large group of lurkers and visitors.


## STEP | DESCRIPTION

### GOAL
Reduce customer support costs by helping members get solutions via the community.

### OBJECTIVES (member behavior)
1. Get our top 10% contributors to answer 50%+ of questions posted in the community.
2. Get employees with 1+ years of experience to highlight knowledge gaps and out-of-date articles.
3. Get [incomplete text].

### STRATEGIES (emotion)
1. Amplify the sense of jealousy and competition between top community members to be ranked in the top 10.
2. Amplify the sense of fear and frustration which could be solved by asking the community to hundreds of experts.
3. Amplify the sense of satisfaction at receiving a quick answer to the question.

### TACTICS (your actions)
- **Objective 1**: Create a leaderboard which ranks and rewards all members by which level they have achieved.
- **Objective 1**: Write regular newsletter updates highlighting the fastest rising stars of the community.
- **Objective 2**: Create on-page notifications which stress the frustration and guide people to make a contribution to solve it.
- **Objective 2**: Create an immediate mailing list campaign which promises members a quick response if they ask a question.
- **Objective 3**: Rewrite the copy, title tags, and meta descriptions to reflect the speed of solutions members can receive.


There are other ways to achieve these objectives (especially with top contributor programs), but the objectives usually remain relatively the same. Most internal collaboration communities would also fall under this category.

 

Template 6: Knowledge-Sharing Communities

Knowledge management (KM) communities (and Communities of Practice) are unique in they often span many of the different archetypes above.

However, the typical KM community emphasizes documenting and keeping knowledge up to date. This saves people time and helps them do better work.

Key Behaviors

The key behaviors here usually include:

Documenting a best practice/lesson learned/templates. This includes actions taken, what worked, where to find useful information, revenue spent, how it was measured etc..This also covers templates for future projects.
Keeping and updating previous content. Once content has been shared, it needs to be kept relevant and updated in a systematic way.
Tagging and properly storing information. People need to be able to find the information. This means it need to be stored in the right place, with searchable names, and properly tagged.
This is a simplistic overview that becomes more complex as the volume of information increases (e.g. what if you have 5 different versions of templates floating around or 50,000 employees across 8 languages?)

 

Strategic Plan Template – A Management Consultancy

KM communities will have the most flexibility among the strategies you can deploy. Sometimes appeals to honor and pride work well and sometimes appeals to collective rewards work, and sometimes fear of punishment works best.


## STEP | DESCRIPTION

### GOAL
Improve staff performance and reduce time wasted looking for information.

### OBJECTIVES (member behavior)
1. Get subject matter experts to document their articles with correct tags in the company knowledge base.
2. Get employees to identify any out-of-date information.
3. Get newly hired staff members to learn how and why to document/search/store information.

### STRATEGIES (emotion)
1. Create a sense of honor around being a professional who properly documents their work for others and not a rogue amateur.
2. Amplify the sense of competition among members to identify and update outdated information.
3. Amplify the sense of belonging to the group and following the traditions of the organization.

### TACTICS (your actions)
- **Objective 1**: Build personal relationships with key subject matter experts and ensure they feel flattered and respected.
- **Objective 1**: Write content and solicit praise from managers for professional SMEs who document their work.
- **Objective 2**: Create a monthly list of members who have identified the most outdated topics.
- **Objective 2**: Try to include updating old information as a performance goal in job descriptions.
- **Objective 3**: Create a short seminar on the power and importance of updating knowledge and why it’s so important.


Above we’ve largely used appeals to the better nature of members rather than resorting to punishments. But you can adapt as needed.

Summary

This isn’t a definitive list of community types. There are plenty of communities based around collective action, crowdsourced fundraising, and plenty other archetypes.

This should, however, cover the most common community goals and the kinds of strategic plans you might develop to support them.

There are multiple different ways to achieve the same community goals through different objectives, strategies, and tactics. The principle is to ensure everything matches up in the most direct and logical way possible. The templates above might help.

# Define World-Class Execution

## Developing the Action Plan

It’s common to dive into a tactic without considering what world-class execution of the tactic might look like.

For example, you might invite a guest speaker to fill a weekly speaking slot. To do this, you could simply send out an invite to a few people, see who is available, record the session when they are free, and post it online.

**Job done.**

But that’s hardly world-class execution of the tactic. With the resources we have made available to ourselves, we now only care about world-class execution of our tactics. Let’s try to do the example before at a world-class level.

## Tactic: Host a Guest Interview with a Top Expert

### Key Elements of Execution

| **Elements** | **Details** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Find an amazing guest** | You would need to find someone people respected, who was charismatic, and who would take the time to deliver something good. |
| **Terrific message** | Your speaker would have something new, controversial, different, or emotionally deep to share. |
| **Great medium** | The production would be high-quality and perfectly match the viewer’s intent. This would not be an hour-long, unedited webinar converted into a video file for others to download. |
| **Big audience** | This wouldn’t be seen by just one or two people but would reach most of the community. |

If you managed to get all four of these, you can be sure the execution of the tactic would be as big as it could be.

You might not be able to do each of these, as your resources are too limited. However, once you know what world-class looks like, you can begin to make compromises from there. This also helps you explain to others what any additional time or resources could be used for.

---

# Example: Newcomer Questions

Let’s try this for another one of our five tactics from the previous chapter.

You can do this for another tactic:

> **Create and maintain a list of first-time questions for newcomers to ask to get started. These appear as members begin typing their question and in pop-up boxes on their first visit.**

What would this tactic look like as a slapdash job, and what would it look like if we put real thought and effort into it?

Let’s begin with the slapdash job. You would write up a list of questions you think newcomers might ask and put that into the onboarding emails. That wouldn’t take more than thirty minutes.

Now what would it look like if we really took the time and effort to do this well?

## Tactic: Create and Maintain a List of First-Time Questions for Newcomers

### Key Tasks and Execution Details

| **Tasks** | **Details** |
|----------|------------|
| **Questions would match newcomers’ biggest fears and desires** | You would know how to get inside your newcomers’ heads and uncover their biggest fears and desires. |
| **Questions that matched where newcomers came from** | You wouldn’t treat your newcomers as a homogenous mass. You might use a system to segregate what questions newcomers see based on where they came from and their current level of knowledge. |
| **Technology optimized** | The questions would be optimized for whatever platform the newcomer would be using. |
| **Right questions at the right time** | Newcomers would see the questions at the exact moment they are most likely to participate. This might be as they begin typing their question, they can see similar questions. |
| **Excellent design** | The layout and design of the questions would be terrific and easy to understand. |

Do you notice the huge difference in the execution of the same tactic?

This will completely change how effective this tactic is. And this is our goal. We want to execute a few tactics extremely well.

---


# Types of Change

## Managing Unpredictable Changes

There are several types of change that can impact a community. These changes can be categorized as follows:

- **The community goals change:** A major shift in the objectives of the organization or department can affect the goals of the community. For example, if the goal changes from increasing customer satisfaction to reducing costs, the value of the community itself may be questioned.
- **The stakeholders change:** Key stakeholders or team members may leave, affecting the level of support for the community. If your boss leaves, for example, you may need to re-establish the link between the community and its goals.
- **The resources are cut (or increased):** This is the most common type of change. Reduced resources may mean more work with less time, team members leaving without replacements, or budget cuts. It may also involve losing permission to execute tasks as planned. In such cases, reviewing and adjusting tactical priorities is necessary.

> "Change presents great opportunities to get extra resources and support for your community (and test new ideas)."

## Responding to Changes

In any change, some elements of the strategic plan must be abandoned while others are retained. Change brings both challenges and opportunities. Below is a structured approach to responding to different types of changes:

| **Type of Change** | **Response** |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **New corporate or departmental strategy** | This is usually a change in goals, not resources. You still have the same time and resources but must adjust focus. - Keep current resource analysis and team skill assessment. - Identify the new goal proactively. - Advocate for the community’s relevance. - Rapidly establish new objectives for the community. |
| **Change in senior stakeholders** | The goal may remain, but the approach may change. - Identify, negotiate, and agree on reasonable objectives. - Ensure objectives are achievable and valuable. - Reallocate resources according to the new objectives. |
| **Change in line manager (boss) strategy** | A new boss may require strategic adjustments. - Provide opportunities for them to add input. - Obtain approval for the new strategy. - Ensure resources are signed off. - Adjust tactics accordingly. |
| **Change in resources (cut or increased)** | If resources are cut, prioritization is key. - Eliminate the least effective tactics. - Focus on tactics with the most reach and depth. - Adapt quickly to resource changes. |
| **Change in team members** | Team changes require execution adjustments. - Identify the skills and passions of new team members. - Recognize skill or knowledge gaps. - Reallocate tasks to align with new team capabilities. |

## Adapting to Change

Most changes are unanticipated but present opportunities as well as challenges. Responding quickly and adapting the strategic plan is crucial. Demonstrating the value of the community to newcomers and decision-makers can help maintain its relevance.

Do not persist with the same strategic plan if significant changes occur. Adapt swiftly and continue progressing.

# Converting Situations Into Tactics

## Developing Effective Community Tactics

Now you can begin converting situations into possible community tactics. This is the area where creativity and experimentation come into play to determine what works best.

Here is an example of possible tactics to achieve a strategy.

## Goal: Increase Customer Satisfaction

### **Strategic Objective 1: Persuade existing members to create useful content about the product**

#### **Strategy:**
Make top members jealous of the top content contributors and want to join the elite group by sharing more content of their own.

| Situation That Provoked Jealousy | Possible Community Tactics |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Not being invited to an event but seeing acquaintances who were. | Organize exclusive events where only top members are invited. Publicize the attendee list and mention the event in the community. |
| Not getting the same level of access as others. | Provide top members with unique access and ensure other members know they have unique access and power within the community. |
| Feeling the top group doesn’t know who they are or consider them inferior. | Build a strong camaraderie among the top group and publish membership of the top group list. |
| Seeing others get awards. | Create awards that can be given to top contributors. |
| Seeing top people get more attention than they do. | Invite top members to speaking events or to address the executive team from the community perspective. Write content that highlights what the top members in the community are doing. |
| Feeling others are about to get their share of limited resources. | Create limited resources/positions which are given to top members. |

You’re not going to implement every one of these tactics. However, this reveals a shortlist of possible tactics to explore.

---

## Goal: Increase Customer Satisfaction

### **Strategic Objective 2: Ensure the number of newcomers asking questions stays within 15% of the current level**

#### **Strategy:**
Make newcomers feel confident about asking questions for the first time.

| Situations That Provoked Confidence | Possible Community Tactics |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Knowing who some of the other people in the group were. | Create a list of current members the newcomer might already be connected to / know through social accounts. |
| Being told exactly what to do and what not to do (including the unwritten rules). | Create a clear guide about asking for help for the first time. Highlight what not to say and what to say. |
| Being in a warm, friendly, inviting environment. | Enforce a strict “don’t bite the newcomer” policy, even for the most repeated questions. Ensure first contributions get a warm, positive response. |
| Having a single person who was happy to help the newcomer out and make introductions. | Recruit volunteers to reach out to newcomers and ask if they have any questions. If they do, say where they can post them and connect them with people they should meet. |

---

## Goal: Increase Customer Satisfaction

### **Strategic Objective 3: Ensure the level of participation per active member remains within 15%**

#### **Strategy:**
Ensure participants feel respected when they do ask and reply to a question.

| Situation That Provoked Respect | Possible Community Tactics |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Being told by someone that their contribution was useful. | Model ideal thank-you responses and nudge original posters to reply similarly. |
| Acknowledgment of the effort it took to create the contribution. | Personally message members who contribute and acknowledge the effort they went through to create it. |
| Being asked for their opinion on future issues or called into a discussion for their expertise. | Create a list of people by expertise and tag them into future relevant discussions. |

Your list might be far more extensive than this. At this stage, you simply want to draw up the biggest possible shortlist of tactics you might use based on situations that have been shown to provoke that emotion in your audience. You are not deciding your tactics now, instead, you are shortlisting possible tactics.

---

## Summary

- Distinguish between tactics that are popular and those that drive results. Do not pursue what others are doing blindly.
- Identify situations that made your audience feel the emotions you wish to amplify. Draw insights from personal experiences or similar examples elsewhere.
- Translate these situations into potential tactics you can use. Ensure this is done for all strategic objectives.

The next step is to prioritize these tactics by their level of impact.

**Ansoff’s Matrix and Community Growth Strategies**

## Who is Your Target Audience?

### Community Goals and Objectives
You have identified both the goals and the behaviors (objectives) which will likely accomplish these goals. Remember to drop these into your template. Your next challenge is to make these objectives strategic. This means understanding which audience you will target and why.

This level does not concern your stakeholders, but it does determine what you will do and why. In the previous chapter, you learned the goal of the community is to maximize the quantity of valuable behaviors. However, you face some limitations here.

### Keep Members Satisfied
You cannot repeatedly message members to perform the behaviors you want. That will annoy your members and drive them away. You can only maximize the quantity of valuable behaviors by keeping members satisfied and influencing their behavior in ways that add value to them.

Many people believe the best way to maximize behaviors is to tell members to perform them. But what if members are already performing as much of that behavior as they are ever likely to? It doesn’t matter how persuasive you are; they simply cannot perform more of that behavior. In these situations, it would make more sense to get new people to perform these behaviors.

## Ansoff’s Matrix
Igor Ansoff in 1957 introduced a simple matrix for planning marketing strategies, which continues to be widely used today. We can adapt this to maximize the number of valuable behaviors we highlighted previously.

### Ansoff's Matrix for Market Strategy
|                   | Existing Products | New Products  |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Existing Markets** | Market Penetration | Product Development |
| **New Markets**    | Market Development | Diversification |

- **Market Penetration:** Selling more of existing products to existing customers.
- **Product Development:** Selling new products to existing customers.
- **Market Development:** Selling existing products to new customers.
- **Diversification:** Selling new products to new customers.

### Ansoff's Matrix for Community Behavior Growth
|                   | Existing Users | New Users  |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Existing Behavior** | Engagement Strategy: Get existing members to do more of what they’re already doing. | Growth Strategy: Get new members to do what existing members are doing. |
| **New Behavior**    | Persuasion Strategy: Get existing members to do something different. | Launch / Relaunch Strategy: Get new members to perform new behaviors. |

## How to Maximize the Behavior You Want
If you want to maximize the number of valuable behaviors, you need to figure out if it’s easier to:
- Get existing users to perform more of their existing behaviors.
- Get existing users to perform new behaviors.
- Attract new members to perform existing behaviors.
- Attract new members and get them to perform new behaviors.

### Target Audience Analysis

| Target Audience | Existing users who already perform the behavior you want. | Existing users who don’t perform the behavior you want. | New users who perform the desired behavior elsewhere (outside the community). | New users who do not already perform the behavior. |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal** | Maximize the level of engagement from existing members. | Get current members to perform valuable behaviors. | Get members most likely to perform the behavior to do so within the community. | Get new members to join and perform new behaviors within your community. |
| **Assumption** | Current members can spend more time performing this behavior. | It is easier to persuade existing members than attract new ones. | It is easy to get new members to join the community and continue their behavior. | There are plenty of potential members who will perform and find value in the behavior once they learn about it. |
| **Use When** | Growth is stagnant (mature) and a large % of existing members are performing the behavior. | Growth is stagnant (mature) and a small % of existing members perform the behavior. | Growth is increasing and most newcomers perform the behavior you want. | Launching a new community from scratch or when nothing else has worked. |
| **Types of Strategy / Tactics** | Engagement Strategy: Technology (mobile, site improvements, reminders, gamification, etc.), Sense of community. | Persuasion Strategy: Content, newsletters, building new social norms with a small group. | Growth Strategy: Direct outreach, conversion, promotion, SEO/content creation, referrals. | Launch/Revamp Strategy: Conceptualize a new concept based upon deep research and understanding of the audience. |

## Understanding the Audience and Their Behavior
By now, you should also be able to write very specific objectives. Imagine, for example, your goal is to increase lead generation. The agreed objective might be to get members to create more content which ranks highly in search engines and brings in more traffic (assuming the same percentage of which will convert into customers).

### Strategic Objectives Based on Audience Choice

| Objective | Existing Users / Existing Behavior | Existing Users / New Behavior | New Users / Existing Behavior | New Users / New Behavior |
|-----------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Goal** | Increase the quantity of content created by existing, active, community content creators to attract high levels of search traffic. | Increase the quality of content produced by existing members to rank highly in search engines and increase search traffic. | Attract quality content creators to create quality content within the community. | Launch a new community to encourage members to create quality content in the topic which ranks highly in search engines and increase search traffic. |

### The Target Audience Matters
The above highlights just how critical identifying the target audience and their behavior is to developing a coherent community strategy.

This shows you where to spend your time to get the best results. Trying to get people to do more of what they already do, as opposed to trying to get someone to do something for the first time, would lead you down two completely different approaches.

You might have noticed the problem with setting a single objective. What happens if you pursue a strategic objective and the overall level of growth and activity within the community declines? You cannot get more members performing a specific behavior if the number of members plummets.

## Summary
1. Use Ansoff’s Matrix to determine the quadrant of people or behaviors you are going to target.
2. Set strategic objectives which target a specific group of people to perform a very specific behavior (valuable behavior or joining the community).
3. Slight changes in the quadrant you focus your efforts on lead to radically different approaches in strategy.
