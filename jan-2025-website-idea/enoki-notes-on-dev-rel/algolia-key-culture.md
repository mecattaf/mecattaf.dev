### The New Paradigm: Engineers as Marketers

Having engineers deeply engaged in marketing is the only way for a developer tool to succeed.

About two weeks into my job at Algolia, I am working with Alex, a software engineer, on a post announcing a new feature. We spent about 30 minutes on it already, and as we dive into a sophisticated grammar point (which Alex seems to really be into), I start to get nervous.

You see, my old instinct — the “oh my God, I am wasting an engineer’s time” one — is kicking in. As much as I know that the post won’t be great without Alex’s significant time investment, it is frankly already decent, so, rather than risk him losing patience (which I naively think is inevitable), I say: “Hey look…not many people read these feature announcements in full…we don’t have to kill ourselves here”.

Silence. Alex’s pupils widen in horror. “What do you mean? It should be as good as it can possibly be.” Thus begins another 30 minutes of editing, during which I learn more about the product, the article reaches next-level goodness, and my trauma from previous jobs starts unfolding.

It’s fascinating how quickly a repressed creature can blossom. Within a week or two at Algolia, I feel like a former prisoner-of-war released into Alpine meadows. You see, in the past, I had to work very, very hard to earn editing trust, even though it was my job. Similar experiences are not uncommon for marketers: from being yelled at for suggesting “too many edits” to delays on providing product release information, to unconstructive feedback on copy. With these experiences in mind (or perhaps the subconscious), my first suggestion at Algolia is to relieve engineers of going through suggested grammar and style edits in Google Docs.

I get massive pushback. “I want to know how to get better at writing” is the message across the board (that, and “are you kidding? It’s 45 seconds at most to accept Google Doc suggestions!”)….even with co-founders who gladly discuss any contentious sentence or paragraph, and will help with whatever you ask them.

I want to scream and shout from the rooftops as I walk out of feature release meetings, where engineers willingly, without convincing or nudging, do what marketing asks them to do.

As I prepare lawyerly argumentations about how hard it is for a tiny content team to be plugged into every single online community we cover (from iOS to Vue.js), I instead learn that engineers already get it, and witness in awe them taking ownership of helping market the features they wrote. “You write, we support” is a marketing-in-tech principle; here, it’s taken a step further: “You do, we support”. It works beautifully.

Engineers meticulously list newsletters and influencers we should follow in their respective areas of expertise. I see them not only recommending which publications to sponsor, but instinctively start calculating results we should expect from paid campaigns — essentially, marketing metrics. “Don’t worry about that,” I say to my colleague Guy, “marketing can do that”. He cedes expertise to me, but wants to understand how it all works, which is super helpful, as always when someone with a (brilliant) beginner’s mind looks at your work.

I see engineers’ faces light up (OK…in the case of ops…maybe just nod :)), as I tell them how content works and what a natural fit it is with engineering audiences — and then I see them engage even harder. Hours of editing and mutual #grit (one of our company values) gets articles to the front page of HackerNews, and even first page of Google search results, like this blog post written by one of our engineers (no black SEO magic, just hard work, and lots of reads and shares).

OK, OK, you might say. Enough bragging about this wonderland of Algolia. You already know about our culture and how much I like working with engineers. But, I say, wait! — you are missing the point.

What I am trying to say here is not that this is how things should work because that makes for a nice work environment. What I am trying to say, rather, is:

Having engineers deeply engaged in marketing is the only way for a developer tool to succeed.

A bold claim, I know, but stop and consider. What are your other options?

If marketing is to be understood as spreading the word about your product, rather than a well oiled but useless machine spewing out buzz words and nonsense while wasting tens of thousands of dollars on liquor and guessing (aka poorly done Meetups and even more poorly done advertising) — then engineering must roll up their sleeves and participate.

Sure, it’s a bit unfair. If we worked in making a consumer product (say, dog food), both the already overworked engineer and the marketer would have it easier. But, those of us who chose this beautiful field of developer tools have to accept the fact that only engineers (and here at Algolia, that includes developer advocates and solutions engineers) can do excellent, in-depth writing on things that matter to our engineering audience. They will also always know better what our audience reads, likes, enjoys, and how to be spoken to. They will almost always have a better instinct on what copy will work and where, what feature aspect to emphasize and how to explain it. Only engineers can give a great technical talk and field every single question in the event booth. There is more, but you get the gist.

What is the marketer’s job, then? Might it seem that we are superfluous in this situation? I’ve seen in the past marketing colleagues mortified that my attitude will work us out of our jobs, yet nothing could be further from the truth.

The “support” part in “You do, we support” is far from trivial. We get to create, run and measure campaigns, plan newsletters, run press releases, organize webcasts and events …(it in fact seems trivial to list everything marketing can do), but, perhaps most importantly, we get to lend that creative nudge, be it in seeing the real story behind your product release, pushing you to give us the best title you can, or turning your talk into a blog post, webcast and featured content in a relevant newsletter.

Last but not the least…working for a technical product is a two-way street. Marketers must devote precious work hours and often free time to learn technology as much as we humanly can (and it helps when you can ask anyone for help without feeling like you are burdening them). We must plop into support channels, immerse ourselves in the community, step away from how we’ve been taught to do (fluffy) marketing, and, above all, stay humble and agile.

In other words, in a company that builds developer tools, both engineers and marketers get to do things we might not have expected when we chose our professional fields. And that not only leads to better positioning of our product, but also to greater empathy and productivity. I’d also argue: to more fun. But that’s a topic for another post.

### Building a Culture-Defined Content Strategy
Thinking about marketing differently: our road to getting 50% of Algolia employees contributing to our marketing efforts.


Earlier this year I spoke at the HeavyBit DevGuild Content Strategy conference about how Algolia approaches content creation. You can find the full slides for that talk below.

When I announced I was joining Algolia last year, I had two large initial goals that I wanted to accomplish. The first was to put words to the Algolia brand to create a consistent internal understanding of who “Algolia” is. The second was to figure out how to communicate who we are across different channels — events, product messaging, sales collateral, and, of course, content.

In order to best solve these problems, I first needed to understand what was already being done. Like brand, content is something at Algolia that everyone does, even if it’s not their job. Engineers document their code, and they also write the API documentation & publish blog posts about their work. Our founders have been vocal as well — our CTO publishes an ongoing Inside the Engine series giving insight into how Algolia works the way it does & why we made certain decisions, while our CEO speaks & writes about our company’s values — 💪 Grit, 🙏 Trust, ❤️ Care, 🚀 Candor & 🍰 Humility.

NB: At Algolia, Candor is a means of removing friction in communication, which leads to 🚀 quicker action. I use 🍰 because there’s no Humble Pie emoji just yet, so Humble Cake will have to do.

Company culture is the driving factor for nearly everything we do at Algolia — from recruitment decisions to paid advertising messaging, from sales tactics to customer support — which mean that Algolians had already found a way to 💪 step up & write, ❤️ give & 🍰 receive feedback, 🙏 sharing what we were doing and 🚀 the problems we encountered.

Collaboration: The Algolia Way

Traditional startups would look to delegate content to the marketing team, who would be tasked with creating content across a variety of topics — employer brand & company culture, news updates, event recaps, thought leadership across a variety of sectors — but that didn’t seem to me how Algolia would do content, and so I began to think: what if instead of taking ownership over content, the marketing team became the ultimate support function and enabled everyone in the company to communicate their thoughts, experiences & ideas.

Looking at our historical content activity, I saw that anywhere from 10–20% of the company was writing every quarter, with an informal support infrastructure in the form of a #anglophone slack channel. I jumped in and began working with engineers on their articles, and quickly found that with a very minimal framework, the barrier to entry could be reduced and the amount of collaborators could easily double.

I set myself a goal to get to 50% of the company contributing each quarter. By the end of the year, that means as many as 85 team members writing content.

Scaling up Collaboration
Getting to 50% collaboration (and maintaining it as we grow) means treating our content pipeline the same way a SaaS company might treat their self-service customer pipeline. In order to be as successful as possible, we need to do four things:

👍🏾 Lower the Barrier to Entry
The quickest way to increase your number of collaborators is to make it as easy as possible to do. There are a number of reasons someone might not write, so let’s address a few of them.

Most people assume that what it takes to write is expertise, and they fear they have nothing to say. I would venture that the opposite is the case: as a journalist, I had no expertise in any of the companies I wrote about, so I relied on them to help me take their knowledge and turn it into a story readers would enjoy. At Algolia, our Content team is constantly on the lookout for a story opportunity. That can come during an All Hands meeting, in the elevator, on a slack channel or in a team email: treating content marketing like journalism, I have become the proverbial stalker at Algolia, always commenting “that would make a great blog post” or popping up in conversations with “you want to write about that?”

When I approach team members for the first time to contribute, the first step is always what I call “the interview.” In this process, I want to accomplish two things:

I want to translate their expertise into a story, leveraging my knowledge of the key messages we’re pushing across a variety of marketing efforts, as well as my understanding of ‘what works.’
I want to get rid of any potential fear of difficulty — I explain our process, how it won’t take long, and that they shouldn’t be afraid to stop mid-process if their work needs them.
NB: we never push anyone to write any article a certain way — that’s the quickest way to turn someone off from contributing.

Once we’ve settled on an idea, I ask them one of the most important questions: “Can you get this done in under 10 working days?” 10 days (two weeks) is a magic number after which the likelihood of an article getting written drops exponentially. In fact, I encourage people to delete articles (or tasks) that they haven’t completed in 10 days — it’s more a burden than a task at that point, and creative work gets harder the longer it lingers. This helps to eliminate fear of failure (and reduce the potential for failure) because they quickly see whether it’s feasible or not

They draw up a quick bullet-point sketch of their story, turn it into a draft, ignoring all of the ‘storytelling’ parts — title, images, intro, conclusion - as long as possible. In between each step, we make ourselves or other team members available for feedback, checking in periodically to see if they’ve gotten blocked on something.

Generally, there are only two reasons an article fails: work takes precedent, or the article raises a question that the writer isn’t ready to answer. For example, when writing about how we approach a certain PHP weakness in order to have consistency across all APIs, the article stalled because we discovered that we weren’t 100% convinced our solution was the best, so we tabled the article for later.

🗓 Flexible Deadlines
Besides have a 10-day mindset, there are no hard deadlines for writers. This puts more burden on the Content team to make sure we can anticipate content far enough in advance to have regular publishing rates; however, we can adjust the content pipeline based on average risk of churn to compensate - In short, we put more articles in the pipe than we expect will get published.

✍️ Open Editorial Strategy
In order to make sure that anyone feels like they can bring something to the conversation, you’ll want your Editorial strategy to be as open as possible. Algolia has two very big advantages here — search applies to all industries, and we’re a transparent company — however, looking at what Stripe & Airbnb have done, content-wise, it is clear that your content is limited only by your ambitions. Broadly speaking, we cover a number of “buckets”

Search Leadership: various aspects (speed, relevance, design) across various sectors (ecommerce, media, saas), as well as advanced search topics (personalization, security, uptime)
Life At Algolia: company values, team experiences, events we attend & lessons we learn along the way.
Community: highlighting individual members of our community and even giving them a voice to share on Algolia Stories
The Content team also owns product messaging — benefits, impact & feature-oriented content — and we look for support from team members to build this content.

With this editorial strategy, we can get recruiters talking about company values, solutions engineers sharing search leadership, sales team members covering sector-focused webinars & engineers sharing features they’re building.

📈Align KPIs with their success
Arguably the most important rule is to align content KPIs with the KPIs that matter most to your collaborators. While our Marketing team broadly focuses on how content can drive awareness, acquisition & activation, our Content team is focused on making articles as successful as possible, seen by as many people as possible.

This means that we put ad dollars behind great content, even if it isn’t a direct pitch for why customers should buy Algolia.

This means that we treat team members who published content for the first time the same way we treat sales team members who closed their first big deal — we share articles in our weekly update, give ❤ on our #celebration Slack channel (where we give praise to other team members for their accomplishments) and make writing a cool thing to do.

Next Steps: Scale
Today, we’re at around 25–30% contribution rate per quarter inside the company, and there are a lot of interesting challenges that we face:

What kind of team members do we want to bring onto the Content Team to own the growth of our strategy?
How can we make writers autonomous and independent from marketing’s availability to give feedback, publish or promote an article?
How can we get more sales team members contributing?
How do we distribute 90 articles in a single quarter? Is that too much?
Can contributing go beyond the blog to videos/webinars, events & other content-driven initiatives?
Each new problem brings a new opportunity to grow — one of the things I love about Algolia — and hopefully I’ll answer these questions and more between now and the end of the year. I’ll try to share our progress as we do, as I believe that this strategy is thoroughly applicable to any company that would like to create a collaborative content strategy.

If you have questions about our content strategy, how you can apply it to your company, or more nuanced questions around storytelling, feel free to ask them below and I’ll answer (or who knows: maybe another Algolian will!)

### Curing blank page syndrome: turn every engineer into a writer
To be honest, I don’t even know where to begin…


If you haven’t already read about Algolia’s content strategy, it’s good background material for this article that you can read here.

When you have a story, there are so many techniques for getting it on the table. You can start with a bullet-pointed draft and then flush out each bullet point, or spill your guts out, then reorganize it…but what do you do when you don’t have a story? At Algolia, this happens often. Every week in fact.

Algolia’s approach to content marketing isn’t unique: we designed it to help every employee publish as often as they’d like. On paper, turning an engineer’s recent feat or feature into a story isn’t difficult: the story is already there, which should make it easy. Where the problems begin is when we, the marketers, see a story, but the engineer doesn’t:

How do you turn a boring release announcement into the story of blood, sweat and tears that building the feature really was?
How do you take hours of technical pre-sales calls and distill them down into a best-practices piece?
Where’s the story in moving into a new office?
The Interview
It is the first step in almost every blog post we publish, and while it is often initiated after a team member announces they will work on an article, it is most important when we, the marketers, suss out a story that might be lying hidden behind the article originally envisioned.

I spent nearly 5 years interviewing founders for a tech blog I wrote, and I rarely knew what I was going to write about before I wrote an article. Whether I was interviewing investors or founders, The Interview got me from interested to sold.

Keep an Open Mind
You never know what a story is going to look like going into it — in fact, if you have an idea of what the story is before The Interview, you’re likely to either skew the entire process towards that story, or worse, miss out on the real story.

You also never know what form the article might take. It could be a listicle — there’s no shame if it’s done right. Don’t decide the form before you’ve uncovered the real meat of the story.

Tip: Avoid “Give me a point-by-point overview of what you’ve been working on,”

Instead ask “What’s the problem that’s been most racking your brain recently?” The more open the question, the more likely you are to uncover the meat.

If you ask a question and have the answer in mind already, you’re asking the wrong question. Approach the subject with an open mind — especially when you’re the one who identified the opportunity in a Slack channel or All Hands discussion — and be OK with the fact that, while something happened, there may not be a story there.

The best stories are the ones where we don’t know the ending when we start. As an interviewer, it is your job to uncover the story. Investigate. Be curious. Approach the same subject from ten different angles and you’ll eventually see it sitting right in front of you: the perfect story.

Past, Present & Prediction
Nearly every article can be broken down into three major plot points — what happened before, what happened after (i.e., where you’re at now), and what’s going to happen in the future. Let’s take a look at some popular types of company stories to get a clearer idea:

A beta release: users had a problem, we built a solution, we will continue to refine it based on your feedback.
A fundraising round: we’ve been working really hard, an investment is being made, we will grow in all ways imaginable.
An event recap: we wanted to engage with a community, we organized an event, we will organize more in the future
Let’ be clear — these three data points aren’t your story. They are just the first line that you are going to draw in order to get a better picture. When conducting an interview, your first priority is to figure out these three data points. The “present” is usually the reason you are conducting The Interview in the first place, so you’ll want to ask questions that will help identify the Past first.

Tip: Seemingly inane questions like “Where were you at with this 6 months ago?” Are a great way to uncover the beginning. The “six months ago” is arbitrary, so let the interviewee guide you: “well actually, this project really started two years ago…”

It’s most likely that you are going to be better at fishing out the prediction than the interviewee. They may have some notion of the future of a feature, but you’re going to have to push back and maybe even change subject to really get them thinking less mechanically. With the past & present in place, you can begin to paint a picture of the story you want to tell by asking questions about the journey.

The Journey: Lessons Learned, Insights Uncovered
Now is the time to figure out what kind of story you’re going to tell. In order to so, you’ll want to ask questions that focus on education, mistakes, and insights. Let’s look at how to dig for each:

Education:
What did you learn along the way?
What do you know now that would’ve helped you on day one?
Mistakes:
What was the hardest part of the process? What makes it so hard?
Insights:
What would you tell other people who are just about to get started on something similar?
What’s the takeaway from all this?
The reason we focus on education, mistakes & insights is not just because a story often comes from how you got from A (the past) to B (the present), but also because readers are looking for the ‘so what?’ of it all. The answer to “Why are you telling me about this experience?” is the story.

Keep it Simple
The last thing to keep in mind is that the theme of every story should be simple — there’s an elevator pitch to every article we put out. Sometimes it’s written right there in the title, but not always. It is your job, as the interviewer, to make sure it is clear after the story is written.

I often use this article on documentation as an example. saying that they key takeaway during The Interview, as I dug in deep with Alex S. on why he got better at writing documentation over time, was that ‘documentation should be like a lonely planet guide book.’ Once we had that, the article wrote itself. Each point we made came back to the same metaphor, and as the story evolved we were able to map out (pun intended) how his work evolved to get closer and closer to this ultimately simple comparison.

Delve!
If you decide that getting more people writing content in your company is important, know that the stories are already there. What may be missing is the person to ask the right questions, to transform an experience into a story, to help non-writers understand that the hardest thing about writing is having something to write about. Non-writers are constantly doing things worth writing about — all you need is a writer to delve into what they are doing to help them see the story waiting to be told.

## Notes from Developer Relations meetup at Algolia

```
# Opener

* General hello and elevator pitch for Algolia.
* Introducing the speakers.
* Highlight "job of the day" - in this case, an Education Engineer (SF/Paris)

#  Valériane Venance, Deputy CTO at Le 24/24, Junior DevRel

* Every company that has a product that is used by a developer can benefit from DevRel.
* DevRel communicates directly to developers, raising awareness both _before_ and during the product lifecycle.
* _Engage_ the dev community.
* DevRel is not sales. They evangelise or advocate for the product, but don't sell.
  * Sales isn't about authentic relationships.
* DevRel isn't _generic_ community management.
  * Developer community sure - but not social media mavens.
* The developer has to beleive in the product. Making that connection is the DevRel job.

## Q&A

* Q: Dev Evang vs Dev Advo: is there a difference?
  * No, I don't think there's a difference.
    * This is the wrong answer. Oh well!
    
# Laurent Doguin, VP Developer Relations at Clever Cloud

* Reponding to previous Q&A: Dev Advo is a two-way street, Evang is one-way.
* Started as a developer, started doing talks and training for customers.
* Got bored by the product and joined the marketing team to try something new.
  * Assumed title of "Community Liason". Goal: _nurture_ community. Notably: _not_ community manager.
* Started working with Matthew from DevRelCon.
* Tangent into content strategy: concentrate on quality at the expense of quantity, every time.
* DevRel competes from "brain attention time".
* Biggest problems in DevRel: budget and org position.
* Marketing is numbers-driven. DevRel is fuzzier.
* DevRel is a cost centre that is hard to measure. You need CEO buy-in or else it will suck.
* "The average lifespan of DevRel is 9 to 12 months, because burnout."
  * Most DevRel that I know have stopped drinking alcohol.
* DevRel is a field, not a job. Public speaking is a skill, not a job.
* "I've become an expert in buying t-shirts. My last order was about 20,000 €. We buy a lot of t-shirts."
* Working on week-ends? Normal. Just travelling for Monday events means working on Sundays, at the least.
* People who leave DevRel often move into Product Marketing.

## Q&A

* Q: Should it be a full-time job or can it be done a little on the side?
  * Tech people in the company can definitely do some aspects of DevRel: talks, blog posts, etc. Be careful on the burnout aspect though.
* Q: We're having trouble attracting developers at events. How do we market to devs?
  * Devs hate marketing. They don't want to be pitched at. Marketing people shouldn't talk to devs unless they themselves have a development background. Most important: don't try to sell anything. You need to create a genuine connection.
* Q: How to convince management that they need to focus on events and DevRel?
  * You need to get your CEO on board. That's where you start. DevRel needs to be sold internally, and it might be _really hard_ to do this in your specific environment.
    * Not every company is designed for DevRel.
* Q: When are hackathons a good idea?
  * "I generally hate hackathons. As a leftist, I think that making people work on the week-ends sucks. But these people are adults and if that's what they want to do, ok."
  * Hackathons have low numbers - but those numbers can be very high quality, so that's the selling point.
* Q: What are the most efficient DevRel strategies?
  * Talks are good but they don't scale (plus you burnout so fast). There's no magical recipe. Just do a good mix of things and build up the follower base organically.
* Q: What is the culture of DevRel in France?
  * DevRel is not so new anymore. It's new-ish in France though. In France it's much more about culture. Europe has _way_ more conferences than the USA, possibly because people want to have confs in their native language. The native language aspect is important in Europe in general, and France in specific.
  * In France if you want to reach people, lunch meetups are a great idea. Most developers can't justify conferences, and have to take PTO. Evening events too. Maybe breakfast? Meetups all the time though.

# Noël Macé, Developer Advocate at SFEIR

* https://twitter.com/noel_mace
* "Being a Developer Advocate in a Development Consulting Company"
* Developer 🥑
* Always wanted to be a scientest, and also a comedian.
* Taught at an IT school. Moved into programming professionally. Eventually become a "technical director".
  * Didn't really like any of that.
  * Wanted a job that mixed "pure tech" and "helping community".
* Was hired as a Developer Advocate at a consulting firm.
* As a consultancy, we don't have a product per se. Our product is our developers talent and energy.
  * We have _principles_ which form the basis of the DevRel programme.
* "Dev Advocac is: advocating for developers' happiness".
* Important to be aware of over-work. Take week-ends off! Lead the dev community by example.
* Dunning-Kruger effect is tough for developers. Some get stuck in the "I'm never going to understand this" phase. Dev Advo can help developers move past this phase.

## Q&A

* Q: Why does a company need DevRel?
  * Not every company does. Our team is an extension of the ethics of our company.
  * Every developer should be encouraged and enabled to do talks, blog posts, etc. DevRel just does this _most_ of the time.
* Q: (Honestly didn't catch this one.)
  * Any company can benefit from Developer Advocates. DevRel grows the entire industry, not just your company - and that benefits everyone.
* Q: What is the component of education in DevRel?
  * Helps us to transmit knowledge, but in a more concentrated way. Also allows us to gather feedback directly from the dev / customer community.
* Q: How do you pick what OSS project to work on?
  * This is a really new thing - somebody else at the company handles it. For now it's really just every person sort of picing a project they like.
* Q: Are you working with Marketing?
  * As a matter of fact we sit directly beside marketing, but we don't work directly with them. We don't "do marketing", we don't have the same mission. We don't really talk about the company very much, for example.
