I'm **Thomas Mecattaf**. I'm a startup founder and AI researcher.

I run several projects:
- [leger.run](https://leger.run) - AI SaaS focusing on local LLMs and hardware optimization
- [agency.agency](https://agency.agency) - Open source tools for building stateful agents
- [aicademy.so](https://aicademy.so) - Notes on agentic coding and my convergent workflow

I've worked as a venture analyst at Charge Ventures (2019-2021) where I applied data science, ML, and early AI tooling. Later, I was the first data scientist at Kumospace, a 3D spatial audio video chat company that grew rapidly during the pandemic.

Most of my projects can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/tmecattaf). Feel free to contact me at [thomas@mecattaf.dev](mailto:thomas@mecattaf.dev).
