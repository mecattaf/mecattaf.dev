I'm **Thomas Mecattaf**. I'm a startup founder and open source software enthusiast with a focus on Linux and local AI.

I run several projects:
- [statsforstartups.com](https://statsforstartups.com) - Data-driven entrepreneurship resources
- [enoki.so](https://enoki.so) - Linux desktop environment tooling
- [leger.run](https://leger.run) - AI SaaS focusing on local LLMs and hardware optimization
- [agency.agency](https://agency.agency) - Open source tools for building stateful agents

I've worked as a venture analyst at Charge Ventures (2019-2021) where I applied data science, ML, and early AI tooling. Later, I was the first data scientist at Kumospace, a 3D spatial audio video chat company that grew rapidly during the pandemic.

Most of my projects can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/tmecattaf). Feel free to contact me at [thomas@mecattaf.dev](mailto:thomas@mecattaf.dev).

When not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech setups, customizing my Linux environment, and experimenting with mechanical keyboards.
