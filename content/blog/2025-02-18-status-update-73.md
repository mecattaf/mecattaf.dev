Hi!

This month has been pretty hectic, with FOSDEM and all. I've really enjoyed
meeting face-to-face all of these folks I work online with the rest of the
year! My [talk about modern IRC] has been published on the FOSDEM website
(unfortunately the audio quality isn't great).

In Wayland news, the [color management protocol] has finally been merged! I
haven't done much apart cheering from the sidelines: huge thanks to everyone
involved for carrying this over the finish line, especially Pekka Paalanen,
Sebastian Wick and Xaver Hugl! I've started a [wlroots implementation][wlr!4962],
which was enough with some hacks to get MPV to display a HDR video on Sway.
I've also [posted a patch][wlr!4977] to convert to BT2020 and encode to PQ, but
I still need to figure out why red shows up as pink (or rebrand it as
`lipstick-filter` in the Sway config file).

I've released [sway 1.10.1] with a bunch of bugfixes, as well as [wlr-randr 0.5.0]
which adds relative positioning options (e.g. `--left-of`) and a man page. I've
rewritten `makoctl` in C (the shell script approach has been showing its
limitations for a while), and merged support for icon border radius, per-corner
radius settings, and a new signal in the mako-specific D-Bus API to notify when
the current modes are changed.

delthas has contributed support for showing redacted messages as such in
[gamja]. [goguma]'s compact mode now displays an unread and date delimiter,
just like the default mode (thanks Eigil Skj√¶veland!). I've added a basic UI to
my WebDAV server, [sogogi], to display directory listings and easily upload
files from the browser.

That's all, see you next month!
