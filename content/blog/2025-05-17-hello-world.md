Hello! This is my personal blog and website where I'll be sharing my thoughts on entrepreneurship, open source software (especially Linux and local AI), and documenting my tech stack.

## A bit about me

I'm a startup founder and open source software enthusiast. I've worked as a venture analyst at Charge Ventures where I applied data science, ML, and early AI tooling, and was the first data scientist at Kumospace, a 3D spatial audio video chat company.

I currently run several projects:

- **statsforstartups.com**: Data-driven entrepreneurship resources
- **enoki.so**: Linux desktop environment tooling
- **leger.run**: AI SaaS focusing on local LLMs
- **agency.agency**: Open source tools for building stateful agents

## What to expect

I'll be documenting my journey with:

- My Linux desktop setup (from "Zen" to Enoki OS)
- Dotfiles and productivity tools
- Thoughts on data-driven entrepreneurship
- Open source contributions
- Book recommendations

Stay tuned for more updates as I build this site out further.
