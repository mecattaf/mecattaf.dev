Hello! 

This is my personal blog where I'll be sharing my thoughts on entrepreneurship, open source software (especially Linux and local AI), and documenting my tech stack.

## A bit about me:
I'm a startup founder and open source software enthusiast. I've worked as a venture analyst at Charge Ventures where I applied data science, ML, and early AI tooling. I was the first data scientist at Kumospace, a 3D spatial audio video chat company. I started my first company Enoki Inc. (Antler Austin S22) which got a small exit. 

I currently run Leger Labs, Inc. where we work on:
- [**leger.run**](https://www.leger.run): Fully managed Open-WebUI deployments for teams
- [**agency.agency**](https://www.agency.agency): Open source tool for building stateful agents

## What to expect:
I'll be documenting my journey with:
- Building the Leger product
- My Linux desktop setup, dotfiles and productivity tools
- Thoughts on data-driven entrepreneurship
