Hello! This is my personal blog and website where I'll be sharing my thoughts on entrepreneurship, open source software (especially Linux and local AI), and documenting my tech stack.

## A bit about me

I'm a startup founder and open source software enthusiast. I've worked as a venture analyst at Charge Ventures where I applied data science, ML, and early AI tooling. I was the first data scientist at Kumospace, a 3D spatial audio video chat company. I started my first company Enoki Inc. (Antler Austin S22) which got a small exit. 

I currently run Leger Labs, Inc. where we work on:
- **[leger.run](https://www.leger.run)**: AI SaaS focusing on local LLMs
- **[agency.agency](https://www.agency.agency)**: Open source tools for building stateful agents

## What to expect

I'll be documenting my journey with:
- Building the Leger product
- My Linux desktop setup, dotfiles and productivity tools
- Thoughts on data-driven entrepreneurship
- Open source contributions

Stay tuned for more updates!
