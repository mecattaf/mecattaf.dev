Psychology & Cognition

"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two" (1956) by George A. Miller
Miller's exploration of the limits of human working memory continues to inform interface design, educational approaches, and how we structure information. As information density increases, understanding cognitive limitations becomes even more crucial.
"Steps Toward Artificial Intelligence" (1961) by Marvin Minsky
Minsky outlined key challenges in AI development that remain relevant. His analysis of learning systems, pattern recognition, and planning provides historical context for understanding current AI trends and limitations.
"Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950) by Alan Turing
Beyond introducing the Turing Test, this paper raised profound questions about machine intelligence that are more relevant than ever as we develop increasingly sophisticated AI systems. Turing's careful philosophical examination of what constitutes "thinking" provides clarity in an age of anthropomorphized technology.
"The Nature of Explanation" (1943) by Kenneth Craik
Craik proposed that the mind builds "small-scale models" of reality to anticipate events. This early work on mental models presaged cognitive science and remains relevant to understanding how humans comprehend complex systems—crucial in an age of increasingly opaque algorithmic decision-making.
"A Study of Thinking" (1956) by Jerome Bruner, Jacqueline Goodnow, and George Austin
This foundational work on concept formation and categorization helps us understand how humans organize knowledge—increasingly important as we design systems to help people navigate information abundance.

Sociology & Media Studies

"The Strength of Weak Ties" (1973) by Mark Granovetter
Granovetter's analysis of how information travels through social networks has profound implications for understanding how information (and misinformation) spreads online, and how social ties function in digital contexts.
"The Public and Its Problems" (1927) by John Dewey
Dewey's exploration of democracy in an increasingly complex technological society addresses many challenges we face today, including how to maintain meaningful public discourse when information systems are fragmented and specialized.
"The Uses of Literacy" (1957) by Richard Hoggart
Hoggart examined how mass media was changing working-class culture. His insights help contextualize our concerns about how digital media is transforming cultural transmission and community identity.
"The Gutenberg Galaxy" (1962) by Marshall McLuhan
McLuhan's exploration of how print technology reshaped cognition and society provides a model for understanding how digital technologies are similarly transforming human experience. His analysis of media transitions remains instructive as we navigate the shift from print to digital information environments.
"Symbolic Exchange and Death" (1976) by Jean Baudrillard
Baudrillard's analysis of simulation and hyperreality anticipated many aspects of our current media environment, including virtual reality, digital identities, and the blurring of real and artificial experiences.

Neuroscience & Biology

"What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain" (1959) by Jerome Lettvin et al.
This groundbreaking paper demonstrated that sensory systems actively extract specific information rather than passively recording reality. This insight remains crucial for understanding perception, attention, and how we might design systems that align with human cognitive processes.
"The Organization of Behavior" (1949) by Donald Hebb
Hebb's work on neural plasticity and learning (including the famous "cells that fire together, wire together" principle) underlies modern neuroscience and has implications for how we design learning environments in the digital age.
"On Intelligence" (1993) by Jean-Pierre Changeux and Alain Connes
This dialogue between a neuroscientist and a mathematician explored the biological basis of abstract thought. Their interdisciplinary approach offers a model for how we might bridge technical and humanistic perspectives on intelligence and cognition.

Philosophy & Ethics

"The Question Concerning Technology" (1954) by Martin Heidegger

His concept of technology as a mode of revealing rather than just a set of tools helps us understand technology's deeper influences.
"Do Artifacts Have Politics?" (1980) by Langdon Winner
Winner argued that technologies inherently embody political values. This perspective is essential for critically examining the sociopolitical implications of AI systems, social media platforms, and other technologies that shape social relations.

More Landmark Papers Worth Revisiting
"The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet" (1997) by Alan Kay
Kay argued that despite remarkable technological progress, we had barely begun to tap computing's transformative potential. He critiqued the industry for focusing on incremental improvements rather than paradigm-shifting innovations. Kay's call to reimagine computing as a medium for thought and expression rather than just a tool remains profoundly relevant today when we often mistake technical advancement for conceptual progress.
"A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice" (1955) by Herbert Simon
Simon introduced "bounded rationality," recognizing that humans make decisions with limited information, cognitive capacity, and time. This challenged classical economic models of perfect rationality. Today, as we design AI systems and decision-support tools, Simon's insights into how humans actually make decisions (rather than how they theoretically should) offers crucial guidance for creating systems that complement human strengths and compensate for human limitations.

Looking back to the late 20th century for foundational papers that anticipated our current knowledge transition, there are several landmark works from the legendary Xerox PARC era and similar research institutions that were remarkably prescient.
"As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush (1945) is technically earlier than you requested, but it's the intellectual foundation that many PARC researchers built upon. Bush envisioned the "memex," a hypothetical device where individuals could store all their books and records and which would be mechanized so they could be consulted with "exceeding speed and flexibility." This paper essentially predicted hypertext and many aspects of modern knowledge systems decades before they existed.
For a true PARC-era paper, "The Computer as a Communication Device" by J.C.R. Licklider and Robert Taylor (1968) is profound. Licklider was not at PARC but heavily influenced their work. In this paper, they described how computers would facilitate human-computer symbiosis and predicted that interactive communities of geographically separated people would be "communities not of common location, but of common interest." They specifically discussed how these systems would transform education and knowledge sharing.
Douglas Engelbart's 1962 paper "Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework" outlined his vision for using computers to enhance human intelligence and problem-solving capabilities. While working at Stanford Research Institute (not PARC), Engelbart laid the groundwork for many technologies that would emerge from PARC. His paper described a system that would help people "comprehend complex situations, isolate the significant factors, and solve problems." This directly connects to the AI synthesis tools your friends are discussing.
Alan Kay's 1972 paper "A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages" introduced the Dynabook concept while at PARC. Kay envisioned a portable educational computer that would function as a "dynamic medium for creative thought," allowing children to access and manipulate knowledge in personalized ways. Kay explicitly discussed how such technology would transform learning by allowing children to learn through simulation and construction rather than passive absorption—anticipating the personalized learning approaches of modern AI tutors.
From the mid-1990s, Pattie Maes' paper "Agents that Reduce Work and Information Overload" (1994) from MIT Media Lab discussed software agents that would help users navigate information overload by learning user preferences and acting as intelligent assistants. Maes proposed systems that would prioritize, filter, and present information in a personalized way—conceptually similar to today's AI synthesis tools.
