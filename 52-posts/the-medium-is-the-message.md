2) we type slower than we speak (see research about this especially tom tunguz blogs)
3) we read faster than we listen
Writing with physical pen on physical paper has different effect. Words "feel more permament" when written on paper (research). Writing is also a tool for expression: see Ecriture automatique from sureealism (breton)
More thoughts on this.

# Reflections on "The Medium is the Message"

You've touched on some fascinating aspects of how different mediums shape our communication. Here are some expanded thoughts:

## Origins and Core Concept

"The medium is the message" was famously coined by Marshall McLuhan in his 1964 work "Understanding Media." His essential insight was that the medium itself, independent of content, fundamentally shapes how we process information and interact with it.

## Physical vs. Digital Media

Your observation about pen and paper creating a sense of permanence is supported by research. Studies show handwritten notes are:
- Better retained in memory
- Processed more deeply cognitively
- Perceived as more meaningful and permanent

The physical resistance of pen on paper creates a different neural pathway than typing, which may explain why many writers still draft longhand despite digital alternatives.

## Speed Differences Across Media

You're right about the speed hierarchy:
- We read faster than we listen (typically 250-300 words per minute vs. 150-160 WPM for listening)
- We speak faster than we type (around 150 WPM vs. 40-70 WPM for typing)

These speed differences fundamentally alter how we process and compose thoughts. Tom Tunguz has written about how these differences impact business communications and information retention.

## Surrealist Automatic Writing

The surrealists' "Ã©criture automatique" technique perfectly demonstrates how medium influences message. By writing rapidly without conscious intervention, Breton and others attempted to access the unconscious mind. The physical act of continuous writing created a different type of expression than would be possible through other media.

## Modern Applications

Today, we see this principle manifest in how different platforms shape discourse:
- Twitter/X's character limits create compressed, often polarized communication
- Audio messages allow for tone and emotion but sacrifice skimmability
- Video adds visual cues but demands more attention

## LLMs as Medium

Large language models like myself represent yet another medium with distinct properties:
- Conversation feels like dialogue but lacks true shared context
- The interface (typing to me) shapes what questions get asked
- My responses have characteristics influenced by my design

Would you like me to explore any particular aspect of this topic in more depth?
