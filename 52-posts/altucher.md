James Altucher makes a mention of early AI 
```
It’s Logic Theorist (1955), considered the first AI program. It’s Perceptrons (1957), one of the earliest artificial neural network models. It’s ELIZA (1964), the first AI psychotherapist that faked it until it made it. It’s Shakey the Robot (late 1960s), which was the first general-purpose mobile robot.

AI 2.0’s Wealth Window is Upon Us!
Understanding what this means, and why you should care, will give you an unfair advantage. Not understanding it, however, could set you up for death by a thousand regrets.

Given the transformative nature of this technology, it's important to remember the typical journey of disruptive innovations. The coming months are likely to have high levels of confusion, hype, FOMO, friction, and fear.

According to our research, there are an estimated 14,000 AI startups. Also according to our research: 99% of them are going to fail.

But, with that said: Many analysts say AI could be a $15.7 TRILLION boom market.

They’re wrong.

James is already on record with his prediction: AI will be the first $100 TRILLION industry.

Here, we're going to dive into what AI 2.0 is… an example of AI 2.0 out in the wild (Minecraft of all places)... and what we think about the Wealth Window.

What is AI 2.0?
Let me summarize what AI 2.0 really means in four words: smarter, better, faster, stronger. 

But it’s WAY more than that. AI 2.0 isn’t 1%... 100%... or even 1,000% better than AI 1.0. It’s thousands of percent better. It’s exponentially, exceptionally better. It’s boggle-your-mind better.

See, AI 1.0 has been all we’ve known. And most people didn’t even know it was groundbreaking. (Nor do they understand what kind of world we’re moving into.)

AI 1.0 is Siri.

It’s DeepMind beating Lee Sedo in a five-game match of Go.

It’s Deep Blue beating Garry Kasparov in a game of Chess.

Even further back…

It’s Logic Theorist (1955), considered the first AI program. It’s Perceptrons (1957), one of the earliest artificial neural network models. It’s ELIZA (1964), the first AI psychotherapist that faked it until it made it. It’s Shakey the Robot (late 1960s), which was the first general-purpose mobile robot.

And a whole lot more.

I tell you all of this because in the 2020s we’re beginning to see all of these early insights of AI 1.0 come together in interesting ways to create AI 2.0.

Believe me when I say there are some of the biggest, most exciting opportunities of our lifetime unfolding this very minute.
