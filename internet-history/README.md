## Description

In this folder we focus on the legendary history of west cost startups, and to a lesser extent east coast startups. 
Lots of learnings that we can gain looking back.

Once this becomes more mature, and we are able to condense it into short presentations, then we can pitch: Xerox PARC but in Riyadh, and go on to raise money for a VC Studio/fund, or a fund-of-funds. 

Key Book: The Dream Machine

To be complemented with Alan Kay's youtube talks

From the Alan Kay 70th anniversary pdf, we find a long list of legendary researchers and inventors. For each of those, we enrich with all their published works and recorded talks if available.

Some of those might overlap, or be missing from, the individuals listed below. They were either Kay's contemporaries or at least considered as some of the memebers of the golden age of computing. We compile and revisit all their contents, one folder per person. The rationale behind this is that no PhD program will teach this, but the truth is their ideas are much more Lindy.

Douglas Engelbart - Invented the computer mouse and demonstrated the first hypertext system, video conferencing, and collaborative real-time editing in his famous "Mother of All Demos" (1968). His vision of augmenting human intellect profoundly influenced Kay.
Ivan Sutherland - Created Sketchpad (1963), the first graphical user interface and object-oriented programming system. His work on computer graphics and human-computer interaction was revolutionary.
J.C.R. Licklider - Envisioned "man-computer symbiosis" and interactive computing. As ARPA director, he funded critical research that led to personal computing and the internet.
Bob Taylor - Directed both the ARPA IPTO (which funded ARPANET development) and later Xerox PARC's Computer Science Lab. His talent for assembling brilliant teams created environments where innovation flourished.
Butler Lampson - Computer scientist who worked on numerous groundbreaking systems, including the Alto (first personal computer with GUI), contributed to networking, distributed systems, and computer security.
Charles Thacker - Hardware designer who created the Xerox Alto's hardware and later worked on early networking systems.
Adele Goldberg - Computer scientist who collaborated with Kay on Smalltalk, the first fully object-oriented programming language, and helped develop educational computing approaches.
Robert Metcalfe - Invented Ethernet at Xerox PARC, enabling local area networking, and later founded 3Com.
John Warnock - Co-developed the InterPress page description language at PARC, then left to found Adobe Systems where he created PostScript, enabling desktop publishing.

Ted Nelson - Originated the concept of hypertext and created Project Xanadu, a conceptual precursor to the World Wide Web. His visionary ideas about interconnected documents influenced Kay's thinking about information systems.
Seymour Papert - Pioneer in artificial intelligence and educational computing who co-developed the Logo programming language. His theories about learning and computers profoundly shaped Kay's vision for children's computing.
Marvin Minsky - AI pioneer and co-founder of MIT's AI lab whose theories on knowledge representation and learning influenced Kay's approach to computing systems.
Niklaus Wirth - Created several influential programming languages including Pascal and Modula. His work on structured programming and language design was important to Kay's development of Smalltalk.
George Pake - Physicist who established and directed Xerox PARC, creating the environment that allowed Kay and his colleagues to flourish.
Larry Tesler - Worked on user interface design at PARC and developed concepts like "cut, copy, and paste" that became fundamental to modern computing.
Dan Ingalls - Key implementer of Smalltalk who worked closely with Kay to realize his vision of object-oriented programming.
Bill English - Engineer who built the first mouse based on Engelbart's design and later joined PARC to work on input devices.
Lynn Conway - Pioneered microelectronics design methods that revolutionized chip design while at PARC.
Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl - Created Simula, the first object-oriented programming language, which heavily influenced Kay's development of Smalltalk.

John McCarthy - AI pioneer who invented LISP, one of the earliest high-level programming languages. His work on symbolic computation and time-sharing systems shaped Kay's thinking about computing environments.
Fernando Corbat√≥ - Developed the first time-sharing operating systems (CTSS and Multics) that influenced interactive computing concepts.
Wesley Clark - Designer of the LINC, often considered the first personal computer, and the TX-2 computer that influenced early interactive graphics systems.
Carver Mead - Pioneer in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design who collaborated with PARC researchers on semiconductor physics and chip design methodology.
Barbara Liskov - Computer scientist whose work on data abstraction and programming language design contributed to object-oriented programming concepts.
Gordon Moore - Co-founder of Intel whose "Moore's Law" prediction about computing power doubling approximately every two years influenced Kay's vision of the future of computing.
Bob Barton - Designer of the B5000 computer at Burroughs, which had a profound influence on Kay's thinking about computer architecture and programming languages.
Peter Deutsch - Programming language researcher who worked on early implementations of LISP and Smalltalk.
Alan Perlis - Computer scientist and first recipient of the Turing Award whose witty insights about programming and computing influenced many in the field.
Chuck Thacker - Hardware engineer who worked with Kay at PARC and later Microsoft Research, contributing to the development of the Alto personal computer and tablet computing.
Ed Feigenbaum - AI researcher whose work on expert systems and knowledge representation influenced thinking about intelligent systems.

Terry Winograd - Researcher in artificial intelligence and natural language processing who created SHRDLU, an early natural language understanding program. His work influenced thinking about human-computer interaction.
Tony Hoare - Computer scientist who developed the QuickSort algorithm and made fundamental contributions to programming language design that influenced Kay's work.
Allen Newell and Herbert Simon - AI pioneers whose work on problem-solving and cognitive modeling provided theoretical foundations that informed Kay's vision of computing.
David Evans - Computer graphics pioneer who established the influential computer science program at the University of Utah where Kay earned his PhD.
Gary Starkweather - Inventor of the laser printer at Xerox PARC, working alongside Kay's team to revolutionize document creation.
Warren Teitelman - Created PILOT and later Interlisp at BBN and PARC, developing innovative programming environments and tools like "Do What I Mean" (DWIM).
Tom Malloy - Computer scientist who worked on Mesa, Cedar, and other programming systems at PARC.
Dick Shoup - Created SuperPaint at PARC, one of the first pixel-based graphics programs, advancing digital art and design.
Jef Raskin - Human-computer interface expert who worked at PARC and later initiated the Macintosh project at Apple, applying many PARC concepts.
Danny Bobrow - AI researcher who worked on natural language processing and knowledge representation at PARC.
Jim Mitchell - Systems programmer who worked on Mesa and other programming environments at PARC.
Alan Curtis Kay himself was a profound thinker who synthesized ideas from multiple disciplines including biology, education, music, and mathematics. He often emphasizes how the collective genius of this extended network of thinkers, rather than isolated individual brilliance, drove the computing revolution forward through constant dialogue and collaboration.
