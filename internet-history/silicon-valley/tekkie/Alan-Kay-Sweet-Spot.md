I’m repeating the use of a video I posted here a while back ([Alan Kay: Rethinking CS education](https://tekkie.wordpress.com/2016/06/01/alan-kay-rethinking-cs-education/)), but I’ve cued it up to the relevant spot.

A line of dialogue from “Star Trek IV” ran through my head as I read this question, and reflected on the fact that I was asked to answer it: Spock said he had to make a guess. Kirk was astonished. Spock expresses doubts about their prospects with him guessing, and McCoy tells him, “He [Kirk] means that he feels safer with your guesses than most other people’s facts,” to which Spock replies, “Ah. Then, I will make the best guess I can.”

I’ve seen Alan Kay talk about this a few times. You can as well, watching his recent presentations on internet video. I mean, you can watch him talk about it right here (it’s worth watching the rest of it).

The “sweet spot” you’re referring to is what Kay calls, “The MacCready sweet spot,” after Paul MacCready, who created human-powered flight, and flew across the English Channel in the Gossamer Albatross.

In Kay’s conception, “Better” seems to be a colloquialism for what most people consider “progress,” which he uses as an illustration for how people miss the boat on qualitative improvement. They’re delighted in seeing upticks in whatever they’re pursuing, but the reality is they’re not really improving anything. They’re meandering through the same ditch—up and down, up and down… Sometimes they go through herculean reform efforts to try to reach an improvement goal, but since it’s just using, or optimizing old ideas, it doesn’t reach the “sweet spot.” This ends up, at some point, in a failure, or a “deflation” of the goal, discrediting research efforts in the same area, because returns on investment were expected in the below-threshold effort, which directed capital and energy toward unproductive efforts for long periods of time. People get tired of the subject area, as a result. That’s why he calls “Better” a disaster. It dispirits the community toward looking at the area into which so much money and energy was directed.

It’s not a matter of quantity of effort. It’s a matter of where you’re directing your efforts, consciously coming to realize what you’re doing, and how you’re thinking, and criticizing it with the aim of finding new ideas that when tested are qualitative improvements.

An example for “better” that he used was reading scores in our school system. And to illustrate how futile the efforts have been, he talked about NAEP reading scores for four-year college graduates (and he said NAEP isn’t even a very good literacy standard), using the fact that those scores have been declining for decades. To give an idea of the deterioration, he said in 1992, 42% of four-year college graduates were proficient to the standard, or better. In 2003, 31% of graduates were proficient or better.

What people miss is the ditch (or as Kay calls it, the “erosion gully”) represents part of the problem that needs to be overcome. There can be instances where the gully is so big, so cavernous, that it can be difficult to see anything outside of it. It can be difficult to notice that that’s what you’re in. It can seem like your whole world. It can seem like reality. People can be strongly focused in it, and committed to it without examination, and so find it impossible to see outside of it (he speaks of this tendency to intensely focus on a goal in one direction as “the monkey trap”). He talks about “problem finding,” and my sense of this is, “finding out that you’re in a gully,” what its boundaries and contours are, and how it’s directing your thinking, and consciously trying to step outside of it for a while, to try to find some new ideas.

What people tend to miss is that the real “silver” that is in “them thar hills” is in the thresholds (the truly new, not just “new and improved” in the common everyday sense of the term, but “new” in terms of what “hasn’t been thought before”). This represents the “sweet spot.”

I don’t remember Kay explaining his metaphor for “Perfect” much. He almost gets to explaining it in the above video, but then diverts onto another topic.

This may be totally off, but what’s coming to mind is that he’s used “Perfect” as a reference point to talk about the risk-aversion of funders of research, that they want researchers to define the end results they expect before they even start looking. This seems to match, because one can imagine that if what was expected is found, one would regard that as “perfect.”

An analogy that sort of fits is looking for the car keys under the streetlight. It’s the area that looks clearest. The darkness outside where the light reaches feels less “safe,” because it requires seeing differently to navigate in that environment, and to find much. You also have to be willing to go down “blind alleys” more, but the way you keep yourself “safe” is approaching the search with a mind toward “safe failure”; meaning if you fail, it’s easy to recover, and keep trying.

If the lighted area is the only place you look, you may not find the keys. However, researchers who do this want to find something. So, rather than promising to find “the keys,” they have more modest goals. They may say something like, “We think we’ll find some mortar in the sidewalk, and since we can see that the style of construction is from the 1990s, we think we will find these components in it, since we know that’s what was typically used.”

To understand this point, I think having an understanding of what “perfection” really means is important. Due to our human limitations and frailties, perfection requires a criteria. It requires a narrowing of scope to something that’s pretty small, in relative terms. I’ll also add that it’s a very brittle path to take, because any error, any deviation destroys it. The goal is so narrow and strict that it takes all the fun out of pursuing it. (Maybe the “fun” is in the end-goal, not the “journey,” when it comes to this.)

As you’ll notice, if you look at the video, the “sweet spot” is between “better” and “perfect.” This is to say that the “sweet spot” is an order of magnitude better than “better,” but it’s not “perfection,” because when you’re venturing into the unknown, trying to find “the problem you’re inside of,” or trying to explore, once you’ve found a problem, is that you wander, with some practices for finding new and interesting problems and goals. You start by going in a particular direction, but you may end up getting off that, and going into things that are totally different for a while, and then returning to what you you did earlier. Along the way, you’ll most likely find that the path you thought you were going to take to find the “new” is not that great a goal, and instead another goal presents itself that shows a truly new way to solve the problem. And the reason you found it was you were “looking and learning” along the way, eliminating weaker ideas that weren’t going to solve your problem in a felicitous way.

In short, you weren’t looking for what you ultimately found. This doesn’t fit with perfection, but then perfection isn’t the goal. You didn’t even know what you found was there when you started out. That’s the whole point of exploration. You don’t explore to find what you’re looking for! You explore to venture beyond what you know, to find what you didn’t know earlier.

Mark Miller’s answer nicely captures much of what I was trying to communicate in the aphorism “Better and Perfect are the enemies of ‘What is Actually Needed’”.

The one thing I might add is that one of several useful ways to think about the “MacCready” sweet spot — what is actually needed — is as *the lowest thing that is *qualitatively beyond* “better”.*

As Paul said when he started thinking about man-powered flight, which the best people in the world had failed at for more than 50 years despite several large prizes: “The problem is that we don’t understand the problem”.

This got him to drastically change goals (I tell this story in a number of talks which have found their way to YouTube).

He essentially told his crew to forget about man-powered flight but to create an air-frame that could withstand “10 crashes a day” — by being fixable with tape and wire.

With this, in a few weeks they were able to make more test flights (and crashes) than everyone else in history over many decades, and got a much stronger sense of the problem. Once understood, this turned out to be relatively easy to solve, and in about 6 months from the time Paul started thinking about doing man-powerful flight, they won the first of the prizes, and shortly thereafter, the big prize for a man-powered flight across the English Channel.

When asked by British journalists why this was possible compared to everyone else, he said “They were trying to make an airplane, we were trying to do man-powered flight”.

Another way to understand this idea is to notice that the learning process frequently really requires going away from what was thought to be the goal. This is hard for us primates! But if it is really new, it can’t be characterized in the existing context, and a new context has to be created to hold the new idea.

I’ve told this story many times to try to help people understand why Parc and the ARPA-IPTO before it were so effective compared to most other efforts at hardware and software design. The key was that ARPA was very happy to fund “problem finding” — not just the “problem solving” that wrongly-named “rational organizations” wanted. By the time Parc started, ARPA had done 8 years of “finding the good problems” and also creating the researchers who would go to Parc and complete the finding process with deep solutions.

Almost all the projects we chose at Parc were at that special sweet spot where they were just barely doable, but also above the qualitative threshold, so that just barely doing them opened whole new worlds.

I should say something about “Perfect”. Picasso said “A work of art is never finished, just abandoned”, and this captures some of the snares of “Perfect”. Human beings tend to be a lot more pragmatic than idealistic, so “Better” is a bigger problem for most. But there are those — I will include myself here — who hear the siren’s song of perfection.

For these, Picasso’s “abandoning” is good to learn. One way to do it on large projects is to associate with colleagues whose strongest urges are to “complete”, and to just let them do this as they see fit, as one gets entranced by beautiful new unreachables.
