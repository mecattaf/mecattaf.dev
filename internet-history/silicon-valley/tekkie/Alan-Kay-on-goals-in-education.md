He responded to a question about an online learning site, called Anki, that’s designed to improve memorization techniques, asking if there was a way to improve it that would bring it in line with goals of Kay’s original conception of the Dynabook. For people who are not familiar with the Dynabook concept, I’ll point you to a post I wrote, part of which was on Xerox PARC’s research on networked personal computing, [A history lesson on government R&D, Part 3](https://tekkie.wordpress.com/2014/06/14/a-history-lesson-on-government-rd-part-3/) (If you go there, scroll down to the section on “Personal computing”).

There’s definitely a way to think of learning as ultimately being able to remember — and every culture has found a lot of things that need to be remembered, are able to get children to eventually remember them, and have some of their behaviors be in accordance with their memories.

But if we look at history, we find large changes in context of both what kinds of things to learn, and what it means to learn them. For example, the invention of writing brought not just a huge extension of oral knowledge, but an even more critical change of context: getting literate is a qualitative change, not just a quantitative one. A large goal of “learning to read and write” is to cross that qualitative threshold.

A change so large that it is hard to think of as an extension of the prevailing thinking patterns in the era of its birth, was the invention of “modern science” less than 500 years ago. It started with the return of accurate map making of all kinds and was catalyzed by the gradual realization that much of “the world was not as it seems” and by being able to make generalizations that could generate some of the maps. One of the most important larger perspectives on this has its 400th anniversary this year: Francis Bacon’s “A new organization for knowledge” (Novum Organum Scientia), in which he points out that we humans have “bad brain/minds” stemming from a number of sources, including our genetics, cultures, languages, and poor teaching. He proposed a “new science” that would be a set of approaches, methods and tools, that would act as heuristics to try to get around the biases and self generated noise from our “bad brains”.

His proposed “new science” is what today we call “science”. Before this, “science” meant “a gathering of knowledge” and “to gather it”. After this, it meant to move from knowledge to context and method and tools — and to new behaviors. This has led to not just a lot of new knowledge, but very different knowledge: qualitatively different knowledge in qualitatively different contexts.

A trap here is that the use of ordinary language for discussing these three contexts — oral, literate, scientific — is that things can be said and heard whether or not the discussants also have these contexts (this was one of Bacon’s four main “bad brain” traits).

E.g. people who can read but have not taken on the scientific world-view can think they understand what science is, and can learn and memorize many sentences “about” science, without actually touching what they actually mean.

Just as interesting, is the difficulty — for those who have gotten literate — of touching what is really going on — especially the feelings — in oral traditional societies. Music and poetry are bridges, but important parts of the innocence and id-ness are hard to get to. “Ecstatic music” can sometimes dominate one’s literate thought — especially when performing it.

To make an analogy here: in our society, there are courses in “music appreciation” that mostly use “sentences” about “sounds”, “relationships, “composers”, etc., in which most testing can be (and is) done via checking “the memory” of these “sentences”.

By contrast in “real deal music”, real music teachers treat their students as “growing musicians” and play with them as a large part of the guidance to help them “get larger”, to “make Technique be the servant of Art, not the master”, etc. It’s primarily an emotive art form …

A nice quote — which has many web pages — is:

“Talking about Music is like Dancing about Architecture”

(attributed to many people from Stravinsky to Frank Zappa). If you *do* music, you can barely talk about it just a little. The further away from inhabiting music, the less the words can map. (And: note that the quote brilliantly achieves a meta way to do a bit of what it says is difficult …)

The Dynabook idea — “a personal computer for children of all ages” — was primarily about aiding “growth in contexts”* and my initial ideas about it were partly about asking questions such as:

“If we make an analogy to writing/reading/printing-press, what are the qualitatively new kinds of thinking that a personal computer could help to grow?”

I got started along these lines via Seymour Papert’s ideas regarding children, mathematics and computing (my mind was blown forever). I added in ideas from McLuhan, Bruner, Montessori, etc., and … Bacon … to start thinking about how a personal computer for children could help them take on the large world-view of science as “real science learning” (not “science appreciation).

(Via Papert), the dynamic math part of quite a bit of science can be nicely handled by inventing special programming languages for children. But science is not math — math is a way to map ideas about phenomena — so an additional and important part of learning science requires actually touching the world around us in ways that are more elemental than “sentences” — even the “consistent sentences” of maths.

In an ideal world, this would be aided by adults and older children. In the world we live in, most children never get this kind of help from older children, parents, or teachers (this is crazy, but humanity is basically “crazy”).

Another way to look at this is that — as far as science goes — it almost doesn’t matter what part of the world you are born into and grow up in: the chances of getting to touch the real thing are low everywhere.

Several of Montessori’s many deep ideas were key for me.

One is that children learn their world-view not in class but by living in that world. She said the problem was that the calendar said 20th century but their homes were 10th century. So she decided to have her school *be* the 20th century, to embody it in all the ways she could think of in the environment itself.

Another deep idea is that what is actually important is for children to do their learning by actively thinking and doing — and with verve and deep interests. She cared much more about children concentrating like crazy on something that interested them than about what that thing was. She invented “toys” that were “interesting” and let the children choose those that appealed to them (she wanted them to learn what deep concentration without interruptions was like, and that teachers were there to help and not hinder).

In other words, she wanted to help as many children as possible become much more autodidactic.

(Note that this has much in common with getting to be a deep reader or musician — it doesn’t much matter in the beginning what the titles are, what matters is learning how to stay with something difficult because you want to learn it — if the environment has been well seeded, then all will work out well. More directed choices can and will be done later. And note this is even the case with learning to speak!)

After doing many systems and interfaces over quite a few years (~25) we finally got a system that was like the Montessori toys part of her school (Etoys), and then, in a Montessori/Bruner type of school (the Open Magnet School in LA), we got to see what could be done with children, the right kinds of teachers, and a great environment to play in and with.

What never got done, was to handle the needs of children who don’t have the needed kind of peers, teachers or parents around to help them. This help is not just to answer questions but to provide a kind of “community of motivation” and “culture” that is what human beings need to be human. (The by-chance forms of this tend to be very much reverted to oral society practices because of our genetics — and much of this will be anti-modern, and even anti-civilization. This is a very difficult set of designs to pull off, especially ca. where we are now.)

To answer your question: the spirit of Anki is not close to what the Dynabook was all about. It could possibly be a technical aid for some kinds of patterning, but it seems to miss what “contexts” are all about.

Here’s another way to think of some of this stuff, and in a “crazier” fashion.

There have been a number of excellent books over the years about the idea that the “invention of prose via writing killed off ‘the gods’ ”. These are worth finding and pondering.*

The two main problems are (a) we need “the gods”; and (b) “the gods” can be very good or bad for us (“they” don’t care).

It’s worth pondering that from the perspective of science, a metaphor is a lie, but from the perspective of “the gods”, a metaphor is true.

The dilemma of our species — and ourselves — is that we have both of these processes in our brain/minds, we need them both, and we need to learn how to allow both to work**.

Learning something really deeply and fluently goes way beyond (and *before*) conscious thought — important parts of the learning are taken to where “the gods” still lurk.

And, just as you don’t make up reasons for breathing (which “the gods” also handle for you), the reasons for doing these deep things move from “reasoning” to “seasoning” — for life itself.

“Artists are people who can’t not do their Art”.

It doesn’t have to do with talent or opinion … This is a critical perspective for thinking about we humans, and what one of the facets of “identity” could mean … Consider the relationship between the quote above and children …

When you are fluent in music, much of the real-time action is being done “by ‘the gods’ “, whether playing, improvising, composing etc. You are not the same person you were when you were just getting started. Music can get pedantic and over-analyzed, but this can be banished by experiencing some of it that is so overwhelming that it can’t really be analyzed in the midst of the experience (this is not just certain “classical” pieces, but some of “pop” music can really get there as well). This produces the “oceanic feeling” that Romain Rolland asked Freud about.

“Goosebumps are a kind of ‘basic ground’ for ‘humanity’ ”

It’s interesting and important that “the gods” can be found at the grounding of very new contexts such as modern science, and that the two can be made to go together.***

To use this weirder way to look at things:

“Education has to lift us from our genetic prisons, while keeping ‘the gods’ alive and reachable”.

* For example: Eric Havelock’s “Preface To Plato”, and especially Julian Jaynes’ “The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind” (my vote for the most thought provoking book that is perhaps a bit off).
